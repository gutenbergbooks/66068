<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">PREFACE.</span></h2>
<p>The natural history of North America has been regarded
with especial interest wherever the sciences have been cultivated
since the discovery of the continent. There never has been a
period, however, in which such extensive and productive research
has been carried on, as in that which commenced with the annexation
of Texas to the United States, and in which also California
and New Mexico have become parts of the Union. The extension
of the laws of the United States over these vast countries, and the
consequent protection and personal safety, have induced the visits
of scientific travellers;&mdash;numerous Government expeditions for the
purposes of exploration and survey have been necessary, and have
been despatched on such missions with the utmost promptness and
vigilance of the public good by all administrations of the General
Government, in the period to which we allude, and have almost
invariably been accompanied by officers specially charged with
making observations and collections in Natural History. The
Smithsonian Institution also has exerted an influence in the highest
degree favorable and important in the development of the Natural
History of this country, as in other departments of science and
literature.</p>
<p>These are the main and immediate causes of the great strides
that the knowledge of the natural productions of North America
has made within a period of little upwards of twenty years. There
are, of course, others, of which the general diffusion of knowledge
and attention to education in the United States especially, and in
fact throughout the civilized world, have been perhaps the most
efficient.</p>
<p>Since the time of the publication of the works of our predecessors
in American Ornithology, the additions of species and of information
in that department of our Zoology have been very large,
and being for much the greater part within our reach, we have
been induced to undertake the present work. It is to be regarded
<span class="pb" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
in some measure as an addition to the works of former authors in
American Ornithology, but at the same time complete in itself.</p>
<p>Our advantages for study have been much superior to those possessed
by former writers in America. There never was in the
United States, until within the last ten years, a library of Natural
History, approximating in any considerable degree to completeness,
nor affording the necessary facilities for the study of Ornithology.
Nor until within that period was there any collection sufficiently
comprehensive to answer the purposes of comparison and general
research. In various branches of Natural History, but especially in
Ornithology, these most important and desirable objects have been
fully accomplished in the formation of the Library and Museum
of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia,&mdash;a result for
which science is indebted, not to the Government, nor to public
patronage of any kind, but to strictly private enterprise and individual
scientific taste.</p>
<p>A new era in the history of the zoological sciences in the United
States commenced with the purchase and importation of the late
General Massena&rsquo;s collection of Birds into this country in 1846, by
Thomas B. Wilson, M. D., of Philadelphia, and the commencement
at the same period of a library in Natural History by the same
gentleman and his brother, Mr. Edward Wilson, now residing in
England. Both have been continued without intermission to the
present time, and the results have been, so far as relates to Ornithology,
that a most extensive collection has been formed, now
numbering about twenty-five thousand specimens, and a Library
containing very nearly every book relating to this branch of natural
science, of which copies are to be obtained; and also, principally
through the personal exertions of the latter-named gentleman, in
the cities of Europe, many that are of exceeding rarity and value.
In several other departments, also, nearly or quite as complete collections
of books and specimens have been made. To Fossil
Remains, Conchology, and Crustacea, these remarks are especially
applicable.</p>
<p>Citizens who thus devote themselves to the advancement of
science and intellectual cultivation in their country,&mdash;whose exertions
tend so immediately to elevate it in the scale of civilization and
refinement, deserve to be ranked with its most illustrious scholars,
<span class="pb" id="Page_v">v</span>
statesmen, and soldiers, and are equally entitled to the national gratitude.
So long as the condition of, or progress in the arts and
sciences shall continue to characterize nations, the influence in the
United States of the gentlemen to whom we have alluded, must be
regarded as important in the highest degree, and their services
will be gratefully remembered by their countrymen so long as the
sciences are cultivated or appreciated. They have reared in their
native city a monument to Natural Science as endurable as its
influence in the minds of men, and more honorable to themselves
than the proudest obelisk or the richest memento of the conqueror&rsquo;s
triumph.</p>
<p>With such facilities for study, we have necessarily had advantages
over other American Ornithologists. One object of our work
is to present a general revision of the Ornithology of the United
States, endeavoring to bring our subject nearer to the true state of
the science than has been previously attempted in this country.
In our Synopsis, the student will find many corrections and additions,
and will find himself, too, very probably introduced to names
both American and European, of the connection of which with
North American Ornithology, previous records are silent, quite
unjustifiably.</p>
<p>Our predecessors have not been well versed in the history and
bibliography of Ornithology, nor indeed have they professed such
information. It is in fact a description of knowledge to be attained
with difficulty in any country,&mdash;so great, indeed, that no one Ornithologist
has ever yet been completely acquainted with the bibliography
of his science.</p>
<p>To our publishers, Messrs. J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co., is due our
gratitude for constant kindness and encouragement during the publication
of the present volume. Our treatment by the members
of this eminent firm has in fact most fully demonstrated to us their
deep interest in the Natural Sciences, as gentlemen of taste and
cultivation, quite irrespective, so far as relates to our work, of
merely business considerations.</p>
<p>To the kind friends whose contributions have added so much to
the interest of this volume, we have to express our sense of great
obligation, especially to Col. George A. McCall, Capt. J. P. McCown,
Capt. S. G. French, Dr. T. C. Henry, of the U. S. Army, to Mr.
<span class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
John G. Bell, Dr. A. L. Heermann, Dr. P. R. Hoy, Dr. S. W. Woodhouse,
Mr. John H. Clark, Dr. Charles Pickering, and Dr. C. B. R.
Kennerly.</p>
<p>To Dr. A. Hall, of Montreal, and Dr. R. Haymond, of Brookville,
Indiana, for much valuable information relating to the birds of their
districts.</p>
<p>To Professor J. P. Kirtland, Dr. Thomas M. Brewer, Professor
S. F. Baird, and Mr. Robert Kennicott, we have also to express our
gratitude for very important services, in facilitating the circulation
of our work, and for much information and assistance.</p>
<p>For facilities for the examination and comparison of specimens
we gratefully acknowledge our obligations to the gentlemen of the
Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia; to Professor Joseph
Henry and Professor S. F. Baird, of the Smithsonian Institution;
to the Natural History Society of South Carolina; to Mr. Edward
Harris, to the Rev. Dr. Bachman, to Mr. John Krider, to Mr. Geo.
N. Lawrence, and to Mr. J. P. Giraud.</p>
<p>Of the superior execution of the plates of our work, it is perhaps
unnecessary for us to speak, but in justice to Mr. J. T. Bowen, and
Mr. W. E. Hitchcock, we may be allowed to say that we regard
them as having in this volume fully established a degree of excellence
in the production of zoological plates, rarely excelled, if
equalled, in this country.</p>
<p>Though we hope and fully intend to proceed with a second series
of this work, as materials accumulate, especially as the present
volume has met with a degree of patronage much greater than
we had any right or reason to expect, we have to say to our
friends and patrons, that at present we have no definite prospect
of such continuation. Should we be favored with life and health,
we hope to present two additional volumes or series, each, like
the present, complete in itself, for which very nearly a sufficient
number of birds are now known as inhabiting the United States,
and which are not given by former authors on North American
Ornithology. At present, our engagements, we regret to say, render
such an undertaking quite impossible.</p>

<br />The Mexican Jay.
<br />PLATE I.&mdash;Adult Male.</h2>
<p>The family of birds, familiarly known as Jays, is so extensively diffused,
that every country of the world produces species except Africa south of
the Great Desert, Australia, and the islands in the Pacific ocean.</p>
<p>The European species are few in number, but that which is the most
common and well known by the name from which has been derived the
popular appellation now applied to nearly all of its more or less nearly
allied relatives, is justly regarded as one of the most remarkable of the
birds of that continent. It is the only species of this family which inhabits
central Europe and the British Islands, and is much admired on account of
the beauty of its plumage, which is for the greater part of a very handsome
light reddish brown, with its wings richly colored of a beautiful light
blue and a deep black. It is a cunning, cautious bird, and possesses very
considerable powers of imitation and of voice in general. Nearly all the
European ornithologists relate instances of specimens which they had seen
in a state of domestication, some of which had been taught, not only to
articulate words but also to imitate various sounds and the cries of animals.
Bewick mentions one which would call a dog, and another which could
imitate the noise made by a saw. Others have heard it imitate the mewing
of a cat, the notes of other birds, and even the neighing of a horse. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
Germany, where the taming and rearing of birds is made a matter of
business to a much greater extent than we have any examples of in the
United States, the Jay is a great favorite on account of this talent, or in
some measure for the same reason that the Mocking bird is in this country.
It does not appear, however, to possess the talent for accurate imitation, nor
the taste nor talent for combination which is shown in such an eminent
degree by the famous songster of this country, but to evince imitative
instincts more similar to those of the Parrots.</p>
<p>Other Jays, of very handsome plumage, inhabit Asia, from the northern
regions of which continent, as well as from northern Africa, a few species
visit Europe. They are not abundant in either of the first mentioned
continents.</p>
<p>The birds of this group are most numerous in America. In the higher
northern latitudes and in the eastern parts of the United States, a few
species only are found; several others, of which some account will be
found in the present work, and some of which are very handsome and
remarkable species have as yet to be regarded as exclusively western,
having only been observed in the countries on the Pacific seaboard. We
beg the liberty of saying, however, in passing, that it is as yet quite
impossible to define, in any reliable manner, the limits of the range of any
of the birds usually regarded as exclusively inhabiting the Western States
and territories of the United States, so vast a central region having been
but very imperfectly explored, and which yet presents to the enterprising
scientific traveller one of the most interesting regions for research on the
face of the globe. It comprises the entire range of country from the
Mississippi river to beyond the Rocky Mountains, from the northern to the
southern limits of the United States.</p>
<p>In Mexico and thence southward to Brazil and Patagonia, and, in fact,
throughout South America, many species of Jays are to be met with in
abundance, and of such beautiful plumage and variety of tints as far surpass
those of any other country. The prevailing hues of the plumage of the
greater number of the American species are the different shades of blue,
from the most delicate ultramarine or azure to deep indigo, generally
variegated, in a very agreeable manner, with white, black or yellow.
Amongst the most handsome of these birds we may mention the great
crested Jay of South America and the West Indies, <i>Cyanocorax pileatus</i>,
a large and very showy species, the Mexican painted Jay, <i>Cyanocitta</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
<i>ornata</i>, which has the entire plumage of a deep blue color beautifully
relieved by a large patch of very pale bluish white on the back part of the
head and neck. Others, such as Beechey&rsquo;s Jay of California and Mexico,
<i>Cyanocitta Beechii</i>, of which we shall give a plate and description, have the
plumage of fine silky blue above, and deep black on the under part of the
body. There are a few species in which the prevailing color of the plumage
is violet, as the <i>Cyanocorax violaceus</i>, a native of the northern parts of South
America, and probably of Central America and Mexico. There are also a
few species of which the bird figured in our present plate is one, in which
the plumage is green, usually variegated with blue and yellow.</p>
<p>The Mexican species yet discovered are of very fine plumage, though
generally of smaller size than many of those of South America. Several
of the species of the southern portion of this continent are, in fact, so large
that they approach the stature of their relatives, the crows, though clothed
in a quite different style of vesture. In fact, some of the larger species are
known to collectors and travellers by such names as the Blue crow, the
Surinam crow, &amp;c. The <i>Cyanocorax azureus</i> of South America is the
&ldquo;Blue Crow,&rdquo; and is one of the largest species of this family.</p>
<p>The Jays must be regarded as highly organized birds, and are possessed
of a superior order of instincts. However deficient in melody or compass
of voice, there are few other birds in which are found combined so many
characters or bird-like qualities. Delicacy of form, beauty of plumage,
vigorous and enduring powers of flight, are united with much liveliness of
disposition, unusual instincts of precaution and self-preservation, and the
ability to subsist on very diversified descriptions of both animal and
vegetable food. They are accordingly entitled to a superior position in
any system of classification, based, as all zoological systems should be,
on the knowledge of functional as well as of organic characters;&mdash;on the
observations of the naturalist in the field or forest, not less than on the
conclusions or discoveries of the anatomist.</p>
<p>Nearly all the species of this group of birds appear to partake to a
considerable extent of the cunning, though not unpleasant nor unsociable
habits of the Blue Jay of the United States, and like it they feed
indiscriminately on seeds or fruits, worms, insects, and even small
quadrupeds, or on other birds. They live principally in the forests,
though several of the fine species of South America and all the species
of North America frequently resort to the orchards and fields, or
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
approach the habitations of men, and when captured young are readily
domesticated.</p>
<p>The very handsome bird which, in our first plate, we present to our
readers, is a recent addition to the Ornithology of the United States,
having been observed in Texas, though previously known as a bird of
Mexico. It is nearly related to the Peruvian Jay, <i>C. yucas</i>, Boddaert, or
<i>C. peruvianus</i>, Gmelin, which is a native of the countries of western
South America. It is, however, considerably smaller, and is differently
colored on the inferior parts of the body, having there a prevailing tint of
green instead of the clear yellow of that also handsome bird, and other
characters tending to establish a clear specific difference.</p>
<p>This bird is abundant in Mexico. It was observed to be quite numerous
on the <i>tierra templada</i> or table lands, and in the hills bounding the plains
of Perote and Puebla on the east, by Mr. William S. Pease, an enterprising
naturalist, who accompanied the army of the United States, under General
Scott, throughout its campaign in Mexico. Mr. Pease learned that it
lived on the sides of the hills throughout the year, and was called by the
inhabitants, the <i>pepe verde</i>. His collection, now included in that of the
Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, contained very fine
specimens of both sexes, though his notes contain little information
respecting them.</p>
<p>M. Lesson, an eminent French naturalist, was the first to describe this
species. His description, from a Mexican specimen, is in the R&eacute;vue
Zoologique for 1839, p. 100. (Paris.) The first published notice of it as a
Texan species is by Mr. Geo. N. Lawrence, in the Annals of the New
York Lyceum of Natural History, vol. v., p. 115.</p>
<p>The credit of having first discovered it within the limits of the United
States is due to Col. <span class="sc">George A. M&lsquo;Call</span>, Inspector General of the United
States Army, who sent specimens to the Philadelphia Academy, from
Texas, several years since, and who has most kindly favored us with the
following note:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first specimens of this Jay that I saw within the territory of the
United States, were in the forests that border the Rio Grande, on the
south-western frontier of Texas. There they were mated in the month
of May, and no doubt had their nests in the extensive and almost
impenetrable thickets of <i>Mimos&aelig;</i>, which are commonly denominated
<i>Chaparral</i>. Of the number of their eggs, or the description of their
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
nests, I learned nothing, not having been able to discover their abode,
precisely; but from the jealousy and pugnacity which they manifested on
the approach or appearance of the large boat-tailed blackbird of that
country (<i>Quiscalus macrourus</i>,) which was nesting in great numbers in
the vicinity, I felt satisfied that the Jays were, at the time, also engaged
in the duties of incubation and rearing their young. In character or
temperament they appeared to be very active and lively, though less noisy
than some other species of their family, and their gay plumage was exhibited
to advantage as they flitted from tree to tree, or dashed boldly in pursuit
of such of their more plainly attired neighbors as ventured to intrude upon
their domain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain J. P. M&lsquo;Cown, another accomplished officer of the United States
Army, also observed this bird in Texas, to the natural history of which
country he has contributed a large amount of most valuable information.
From the interesting memoranda which he has very generously and
promptly furnished for our use in the present work, we make the following
extract:</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the several years that I was in Texas, I frequently saw this Jay,
but never above Ringgold Barracks or north of the woods which skirt the
Rio Grande. It appeared to prefer the Acacia groves which have sprung
up where the ground has been overflowed. Though I have shot numerous
specimens it is rather a cautious bird. I have seen nests high up in the
trees alluded to, and always supposed them to belong to this species, but
was never clearly satisfied, though I have no doubt that it breeds in
Texas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The figure in our plate is about three-fourths of the natural size.</p>
<p>The plant represented is the <i>Salvia coccinea</i>, which is a native of the
southern parts of North America.</p>

<br />The Californian Woodpecker.
<br />PLATE II.&mdash;Male and female.</h2>
<p>The most richly colored Woodpeckers of North America, at least in our
Opinion, are two of the most abundant species. We allude to the bird now
before us, and to the well-known red-headed Woodpecker, <i>Melanerpes
erythrocephalus</i>, (Linn.) in both of which the prevailing colors are a
fine glossy black and a rich crimson.</p>
<p>Were the latter bird less common in the Atlantic States, his claims to
be considered one of our finest plumaged species would perhaps be more
distinctly recognised, and his very showy head of the finest crimson could
not fail to attract admirers. As, however, he has the disadvantage of an
attributed disposition to take liberties entirely forbidden by the farmer and
gardener, and is moreover to be seen in almost every woodland in the
summer season, his gay appearance is by no means duly appreciated, nor his
general character held in high estimation. He is however not so abundant
as formerly, and with the destruction of the large trees of the forest, which
is constantly carried on to make room for the increasing population in the
more densely settled States, the time may arrive when the sight of the
red-headed woodpecker, with his brilliant plumage, will be an unusual and
pleasing circumstance to the young, and serve to remind the aged of perhaps
long-forgotten incidents and associations of early life when remnants of the
forest yet flourished even in proximity to cities, or varied the aspect of
cultivated districts.</p>
<p>Our present species is one of the most abundant of the birds of
California. It appears to take the place of the red-headed woodpecker in
the countries west of the Rocky Mountains, extending its range from
Oregon into Mexico, and probably to Guatimala and other countries of
Central America. It is not inferior to that species in the beauty of its
colors, is quite as unwary and familiar in its disposition, and when the
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
population of the great Western States shall have arrived at such a very
desirable stage of progress as to possess a generation of juvenile sportsmen,
our bird will no doubt be quite as great a favorite on holiday shooting
excursions.</p>
<p>Several species of woodpeckers have had ascribed to them the habit of
accumulating stores of provisions in anticipation of the approach of winter,
but we have no knowledge of this being done by any American species,
except that now before us. For it we can claim this degree of instinctive
prudence on undoubted evidence, and shall have the pleasure, in the present
article, of laying before our readers an account of it, which is not only a
remarkable illustration of instinct, but shows a singular method of mechanical
preparation and management.</p>
<p>Our valued friends, Mr. John G. Bell of New York, and Dr. A. L.
Heermann of Philadelphia, both of whom have made extended visits to
California for the purpose of investigating its Natural History, found this
woodpecker very abundant in all the parts of that country which either of
them visited.</p>
<p>The former gentleman has had the kindness to inform us, that he
considers it by far the most extensively diffused and common woodpecker of
that country. He represents it as somewhat disposed to gregariousness in
its habits, and has frequently seen individuals on the same tree so numerous
and so close together, that several might have been killed at a single
discharge. According to Mr. Bell, its note very considerably resembles
that of the red-headed woodpecker, which it much resembles also in flight
and other general characters. He observed it only on trees, particularly
on the pines; and upon examination found the contents of the stomachs of
all the specimens which were procured by him, to be composed principally of
ants, of which several of the species of California habitually frequent trees.
The large collection of birds brought home by Mr. Bell contained numerous
specimens of this species.</p>
<p>The account given by Dr. Heermann of this bird is of a highly interesting
character, and he has identified, for the first time, the species of woodpecker
of which previously nothing could be accurately made out from the
statements of travellers respecting a bird which possessed the provident and
curious instinct of storing away a supply of food for the winter in holes
made for that purpose in the bark of trees. His remarks are in his
&ldquo;Notes on the Birds of California observed during a residence of three
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
years in that country,&rdquo; published in the Journal of the Academy of
Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, Vol. II. p. 270. (Quarto 1853,) from
which we transcribe the following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the noisiest and most abundant of the woodpeckers of California.
Perched on the topmost branch of a tree, it darts suddenly into the air in
pursuit of an insect, and having secured its object, soon again returns to
the same place, only to repeat this man&oelig;uvre in a few moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the fall season this species is busily engaged in digging small holes
in the bark of the pines and oaks, to receive acorns, one of which is placed
in each hole, and is so tightly fitted or driven in, that it is with difficulty
extracted. Thus the bark of a large pine, forty or fifty feet high, will
present the appearance of being closely studded with brass nails, the heads
only being visible. These acorns are thus stored in large quantities, and
serve not only the woodpecker during the winter season, but are trespassed
on by the jays, mice and squirrels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nest of this bird is dug out in the body of a tree, and is from six
inches to two feet in depth. The eggs, four or five in number, are pure
white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following graphic and intelligent account, to the same purpose, is
from Kelly&rsquo;s Excursion to California, and is evidently from the pen of an
excellent observer and an agreeable writer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In stripping off the bark of this tree, I observed it to be perforated with
holes, larger than those which a musket ball would make, shaped with the
most accurate precision as if bored under the guidance of a rule and
compass, and many of them filled most neatly with acorns. Earlier in the
season I had remarked such holes in most of all the softer timber, but
imagining that they were caused by wood insects, I did not stop to examine
or inquire, but now finding them studded with acorns, firmly fixed in, which
I knew could not have been driven there by the wind, I sought for an
explanation, which was practically given me by Captain S&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s pointing
out a flock of woodpeckers, busily and noisily employed in the provident
task of securing the winter&rsquo;s provision. For it appears that this sagacious
bird is not all the time thriftlessly engaged in &lsquo;tapping the hollow
beach tree&rsquo; for the mere idle purpose of empty sound, but spends its
summer season in picking these holes, in which it lays its store of food for
the winter, where the elements can neither affect nor place it beyond their
reach, and it is regarded as a sure omen that the snowy period is
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
approaching when these birds commence stowing away their acorns, which
otherwise might be covered by its fall. I frequently have paused from my
chopping, to watch them in the neighborhood, with the acorns in their bills,
half clawing, half flying around the tree, and have admired the adroitness
with which they tried it at different holes until they found one of its exact
calibre; when, inserting the pointed end, they tapped it home most
artistically with the beak, and flew down for another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the natural instinct of this bird is even more remarkable in the
choice of the nuts, which are invariably found to be sound, whereas it is
an utter impossibility in selecting them for roasting, to pick up a batch that
will not have a large portion of them unfit for use, the most smooth and
polished frequently containing a large grub generated within. Even the
wily Digger Indian, with all his craft and experience, is unable to arrive at
any thing like an unerring selection, while in a large bag full, that we took
from the bark of our log, there was not one containing the slightest germ of
decay. These woodpeckers never encroach on their packed stores until all
the nuts on the surface of the ground are covered with snow, when they
resort to those in the bark, and peck them of their contents without
removing the shell from the hole. The bark of the pine tree, from its
great thickness, and the ease of boring, is mostly sought for by these birds
as their granary for the winter season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This extraordinary example of instinct is scarcely surpassed by any other
which has been observed in the animal kingdom, and it is to be hoped that
further accounts will be furnished by observers in the countries which it
inhabits, respecting the bird which is endowed with such interesting and
unusual habits.</p>
<p>This woodpecker is common in Mexico in woods on the table lands, and
was observed by Mr. Pease also in the upper part of the <i>tierra caliente</i>. It was
first introduced to notice from Mexican specimens received from the vicinity
of Real del Monte by Mr. Swainson, a distinguished English naturalist,
who first described it in the Philosophical Magazine, 1827, p. 439 (London.)
It was observed in California previous to that country having become a part
of the United States, by Mr. Nuttall, the eminent botanist and zoologist,
who gave it a place in his Manual of the Ornithology of the United States
and of Canada. Vol. I., p. 682 (Boston, 1840.)</p>
<p>Our figures are rather less than one-third of the size of life.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Observations.</span> The bird described by Temminck as <i>Picus melanopogon</i>
is stated by him to have been received from Mexico, and his figure is
certainly the bird which is the subject of our present article. His
description and figure are in Livraison 76 of the Planches Colorices, which
was published about 1828 or 1829, but bears no date, and was anticipated
by Swainson&rsquo;s publication in the Philos. Magazine.</p>
<p>In the Revue et Magazin de Zoologie, for 1849, p. 542, M. Alfred
Malherbe, who has devoted much attention to the study of the woodpeckers,
has named a species <i>Melampicos flavigula</i>, and has very carefully pointed
out differences which he considers sufficient to establish it as distinct from
<i>Picus melanopogon</i>. He relies almost entirely on the greater or lesser
extent and relative widths of the white, black and red spaces on their heads.
Notwithstanding the extensive knowledge which M. Malherbe undoubtedly
possesses from his great attention to this family of birds, I cannot see that
there are any characters given which may not be very properly attributed
to differences in age or sex, and I have accordingly felt myself justified in
suspecting it to be the same as the present species, having before me
specimens which I understand to represent both of them.</p>
<p>No dependence can be placed in the extent of the red color on the head,
as a character, so far as I have observed, in the woodpeckers of the United
States. In <i>Picus pubescens</i>, a common species in Pennsylvania, the young
male has the head above entirely crimson, which color in the adult is
restricted to a narrow occipital band. I do not know that the change in
others of our species is so decided, but the width of the occipital stripe is
much varied in different specimens of the same species, and my impression
is, that as a specific character this very ornamental portion of the plumage
of woodpeckers ought to be estimated with great caution.</p>

<br />The Black-crested Chickadee.
<br />PLATE III.&mdash;Male and Female.</h2>
<p>The pleasant little birds of the same family as those known in Great
Britain as Tits or Tit-mice, have received in America, from the characteristic
notes of several of the species, the name of Chickadees. Popular names
being entirely of a local character and of little scientific value, we
invariably prefer to give those by which species are known in this country
instead of the names of birds allied to or resembling them which inhabit
Europe, though the latter are generally adopted by American writers.</p>
<p>The species of this family, which are permanent residents in the middle
and northern States, and especially the tufted or crested Chickadee (<i>L.
bicolor</i>,) are among the very first of the feathered inhabitants of our woodlands
to welcome the advent of spring, and to hail with their clear and
melodious notes the earliest tokens of the decline of winter. Even on fine
days in February or early in March, the crested Chickadee may often be
heard, apparently indulging himself in gratifying anticipations of the
approaching spring-time; or it may be, that not being instinctively weather-wise
like the beaver, and not at all versed in wise saws or modern instances,
he thinks that it has already come. Which conclusion, though sometimes
adopted quite as summarily by tidy house-keepers, is very apt to be
demonstrated by the storms of St. Patrick&rsquo;s day to be entirely illusory.</p>
<p>The tits or chickadees are abundant birds in the temperate and northern
regions of both hemispheres, most so perhaps in Europe, though the
researches of ornithologists have added numerous species to those formerly
known to inhabit Asia and America. Several very handsome birds of this
family have been discovered, within a few years, inhabiting the Himalaya
mountains, and other parts of India, and in Japan. In North America the
species have increased from two only, which were figured by the celebrated
Wilson, to twelve, the additions having been principally from the Western
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
States, and from Texas and Mexico, and there can be no doubt that in the
almost unexplored countries of North-Western America as well as in those
which have received a greater degree of the attention of zoological
travellers, such as Texas, California and Mexico, others yet remain to be
discovered.</p>
<p>There are about fourteen European species of this group of birds, and
about twenty which are exclusively Asiatic. A few species of allied
genera inhabit Africa and New Zealand, but none of near relationship
have yet been found in Australia nor in South America.</p>
<p>The species of all countries appear to be very similar in their habits, and
live almost entirely in the forests, subsisting exclusively on insects in the
summer, and in the winter partially substituting seeds and berries for their
more grateful food.</p>
<p>The black-crested chickadee is a native of Texas and probably also of
Mexico. It was discovered in the former country by Mr. John Woodhouse
Audubon, a son of the distinguished ornithologist, and was first described by
us in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.
It is very similar to the crested chickadee in form and general appearance,
but exhibits a striking difference in having the crest entirely black, by which
character it is distinguished from all others of the genus to which it
belongs.</p>
<p>The only information that we have obtained relative to its history has
been communicated to us by Samuel W. Woodhouse, M. D., who was
attached, as surgeon and naturalist, to a party under the command of
Captain Sitgreaves of the Topographical Engineers of the Army of the
United States, which surveyed the rivers Zunia and the Colorado of the
west, by order of the Government.</p>
<p>Dr. Woodhouse has had the kindness to allow us to copy the following
memoranda from his Journal, which will be published at an early period,
with the Report made by Captain Sitgreaves to the Topographical Department,
and will be an important contribution to the natural history of Texas
and New Mexico:</p>
<p>&ldquo;While our party was encamped on the Rio Salado in Texas, near San
Antonio, in March, 1851, I observed this handsome little chickadee for the
first time. It was busily engaged in capturing insects among the trees on the
bank of the stream, and like the other species of its family, was incessantly
in motion and very noisy. At our camp at Quihi, on the eighth of May, I
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
again found it very abundant among the oaks. The young males, which
were then fully grown, much resembled the adult females, both wanting the
black crest which characterizes the male. Afterwards I noticed this species,
occurring sparingly, along our route, as far as the head waters of the San
Francisco river in New Mexico.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I observed it almost entirely in trees bordering streams of water, the
females and young males invariably having the crest of the same cinereous
color as their general plumage, but in the latter slightly tinged with brown.
It occurred in small parties, appeared to be very sociable and lively
in its habits, and in general appearance and in nearly all its notes
which I heard, it so very much resembled the common crested chickadee
of the Northern States as scarcely to be recognized as a distinct species at
a short distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The collection made by Dr. Woodhouse contains fine specimens of this
bird, from a male and female of which, and from Mr. Audubon&rsquo;s specimens,
our plate has been prepared. We have represented both sexes about three-fourths
of the natural size.</p>
<p>The plant figured is the <i>Phlox Drummondii</i>, a beautiful species which is
a native of New Mexico and California.</p>

<h3 id="c10">I. GENUS PARUS. <span class="sc">Linn&aelig;us.</span> Syst. Nat. I. p. 340. (1766.)</h3>
<p>Not crested, bill short, rather strong, conic, entire, nostrils at the base of the bill and
concealed by projecting feathers. Wings moderate, with the first quill spurious, fourth and
fifth usually longest and nearly equal, tail rather long, legs and feet rather robust, claws
curved and sharp. Colors usually cinereous and black.</p>
<p>This genus originally included all the birds now usually regarded as constituting a family
of many genera, species of which inhabit nearly all the countries of the world. As restricted,
it appears properly to embrace numerous species without crests found in Asia, Europe, and
America; nearly all of which have the upper part of the head and throat black. A further
division has however been made by Professor Kaup, of Darmstadt; and all the American, with
some European and Asiatic non-crested species, form his genus <i>P&oelig;cila</i>.</p>
<p>The American species are as follows:</p>
<p>1. <span class="sc">Parus atricapillus.</span> Linn. Syst. Nat. I. p. 341 (1766). The black-capped Chickadee.</p>
<p>Length (of skin) about 5 inches. Head and neck above and large space on the throat

sides of the neck white. Entire plumage of the body above cinereous, strongly tinged with
reddish brown, below ashy white, tinged with yellowish brown, especially on the sides and
flanks, external web of outer tail feathers nearly pure white. Bill and feet dark. Tail
comparatively longer than in either of the preceding species.</p>

and the specimens which I have seen have the bill longer and more pointed, the tail much
longer, the black space on the head more restricted, and the general coloring more tinged
with brown. The white outer edges of the external tail feathers is a well-marked
character.</p>
<p>4. <span class="sc">Parus montanus.</span> Gambel, Proc. Acad. Philada. I. p. 259, (April, 1843.)</p>
<p>Length (of skin) about 5 inches. Head and neck above, line through the eye, space on the

the fourth and fifth primaries usually longest, tail rather long, legs and feet robust, the latter
rather large, and provided with curved, strong and very sharp claws. Prevailing color of all
known American species, cinereous.</p>
<p>This genus comprises the crested species of Europe and America, which were formerly

European bird. I have no doubt that the names given above are synonymous; that applied
by us being about one month later than the publication of the description by Bonaparte
as cited.</p>
<h3 id="c12">III. GENUS PSALTRIA. <span class="sc">Temminck.</span> Pl. Col. III.</h3>
<p>Bill very short, thick, upper mandible curved, entire, nearly of the same thickness as the
lower, nostrils basal, concealed by projecting feathers, wings rather short, first quill spurious,
fourth and fifth longest and nearly equal, tail long and slightly wedge-shaped. Tarsi long
and slender, feet rather strong, claws curved and acute, that on the posterior toe strongest.
Not crested, colors of all known species principally cinereous and white.</p>
<p>This genus was established by the celebrated naturalist Temminck, of Leyden, (in Planches
Coloriees, vol. iii.) with a little bird as its type named by him <i>Psaltria exilis</i>, which inhabits
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
<span class="sc">Java</span>. The bird discovered by Dr. Townsend in Oregon, and now well known to American
Ornithologists as <i>Parus minimus</i>, Townsend, not only belongs to this genus, but only materially
differs in size from <i>Psaltria exilis</i>. Temm. Its colors and general appearance much
resemble it.</p>
<p>The American species are:</p>

which respect we coincide with Prof. Westerman, who gives a description and excellent figure
of it in Contributions to Zoology, (Bijdragen tot de Dierkunden,) Amsterdam, 1851.</p>
<p>A few other names have been given to American species of the old genus <i>Parus</i> by the
earlier authors, all of which are undoubtedly synonymes for those of species previously
described, and which we have enumerated. We have in all cases given the authority for the
first description and its date.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Cham&aelig;a fasciata.</span> (Gambel) a bird of California&mdash;though described originally, but as Dr.

<p>This singularly, we had almost said, fantastically colored, though very
handsome Partridge, is an inhabitant of Texas and Mexico. No other
species presents such a remarkable arrangement of colors, and the black
lines in the face of the male bird, as the eminent English Ornithologist,
Mr. Gould, very appropriately observes, &ldquo;forcibly remind one of the painted
face of the clown in a pantomime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has, until recently, been an exceedingly rare and highly prized bird in
collections, a few specimens only having reached Europe or the cities on the
Atlantic seaboard of the United States. Those have received names, and
have been described by various European authors, as will appear from
the synonymes included in the present article; but neither of them have
published any information relative to the habits or history of this curious
bird, nor have indicated the district of Mexico from which it had been
received. It has been known only as a museum species.</p>
<p>Since the commencement of the military operations of the United States
in Texas, New Mexico and California, and the subsequent incorporation of
those countries into this great Confederacy, their natural history has
attracted a large share of the attention of naturalists and students at home,
and also of many highly accomplished officers of the army. In fact, to the
latter gentlemen is to be awarded the high merit of having contributed,
notwithstanding the engrossing and deeply responsible character of their
professional duties, a large portion of all that is known relative to the
zoology of those vast, and especially in a scientific point of view, very
interesting regions.</p>
<p>A valuable notice of the Massena Partridge is given by our highly
esteemed friend, Col. McCall, in his &ldquo;Remarks on the habits of birds met
with in Western Texas, between San Antonio and the Rio Grande, and in New
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
Mexico, with descriptions of several species believed to have been hitherto
undescribed,&rdquo; published in the Proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy,
V. p. 213, (June, 1851,) which we have taken the liberty of transferring
to our pages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This species was not seen before crossing the San Pedro, but it was
not long until it made its appearance in the waste and rocky region into
which we then entered. And from that time until we reached the Rio
Pecos, a distance of 140 miles, (westwardly by the route travelled,) it
was frequently seen, though I should not say it was very common. This
region is a desert of great length from north to south, our trail crossing
it at nearly right angles. The general face of the country is level, and
consists of either a crumbling argillaceous limestone, or a coarse grey
sand, producing nothing but a sparse growth of sand plants. Water is
found only at long intervals, and except at those points there is little
cover for game, and apparently less food,&mdash;the principal growth being
<i>Cacti</i>, of which the most common is <i>Cactus arborescens</i>; yet here, amongst
projecting rocks, or on the borders of dry gullies, or in loose scrub, I
found the Massena Partridge in all the beauty of his rich and varied
plumage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The habits of this species are different from those of any other species
of partridge that I have met with. They were in covies of from eight
to twelve individuals, and appeared to be extremely simple and affectionate
in disposition. In feeding, they separated but little, keeping up a social
<i>cluck</i> all the time. They were so gentle as to evince little or no alarm
on the approach of man; scarcely moving out of his way as he passed,
and only running off or flying a few yards, when perhaps half their
numbers were laid low by a shot. This inclined me to think they might
with little difficulty be domesticated, although I found them here in a
boundless, barren waste, and nowhere near the habitation of man. This
trait of gentleness is the very opposite of those strikingly manifested by
the scaly partridge, (<i>Callipepla squamata</i>,) which I always observed to
be, though found perchance in grounds as little frequented as these,
remarkably vigilant, shy, and difficult to approach. The call or signal
note of this species is peculiar. I never saw it after crossing the Pecos
river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Col. McCall&rsquo;s observations on the habits of this bird confirm an opinion
expressed by Mr. Gould in his Monograph of American Partridges: &ldquo;No
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
account whatever has yet reached us of the habits and economy of this
species, which, judging from the comparative shortness of the toes, and the
great development of its claws, we may expect to be different from those of
other members of the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The circular spots which are numerous on the inferior parts of the body
in this partridge, appear to indicate as a character an analogy to the Guinea
fowls, which is further sustained by its habit of uttering its note continually
when in company with its fellows, or when feeding. The Guinea fowls in
their native wilds also associate in small parties, and take wing only
reluctantly, and for short distances.</p>
<p>Capt. S. G. French, of the U. S. Army, has most kindly and very
opportunely presented us with fine specimens of this and other species
preserved in spirits, for which, as well as for some valuable memoranda, we
beg here to express our gratitude. He remarks, with reference to this
species: &ldquo;It was in the summer of 1846, when crossing the then pathless and
untrodden plains or table lands which extend westwardly from San Antonio,
Texas, to New Mexico, that I first met with this beautiful partridge. On a
bright summer afternoon, I undertook the ascent of a high rocky mountain
for the purpose of obtaining a view of the valley through which the San
Pedro river takes its course, and when I had gained the summit I observed
several of these birds, a few feet only in advance of me, running
along over the fragments of rocks and through the dwarf bushes, which
grew wherever there was sufficient soil. Their handsome plumage and their
gentleness attracted my attention, and I felt many regrets that I had left
my gun behind me, thereby losing the opportunity of securing specimens
for examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few days afterwards, however, when encamped on the head waters
of the river, I found a covey, and succeeded in obtaining several specimens,
one of which I had skinned, but which was afterwards unfortunately lost.
From that point we occasionally met with these birds on the route to the
Pecos river, a distance of over one hundred miles. I did not see them
again until we came to the Eagle Springs, in a mountainous region about
twenty-five miles from the Rio Grande. Two covies were found there, and
several specimens were obtained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the spring of 1851, I again passed over the same route in charge of
a military expedition, and on the way out, two of these birds only were
seen, one of which, (a female,) was killed by Major E. Backus, U. S. Army,
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
and is now in the collection of Dr. Woodhouse, who was then going out
with a party of topographical engineers to which he was attached. When
returning in July last, I chanced to kill at an encamping ground near
Howard&rsquo;s Springs, between the San Pedro and Pecos rivers, the specimen
which I now send you. It was the only one that I saw on the route as
I came back from New Mexico, and it is but fair to conjecture that these
birds are not at all numerous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They appear to inhabit the rocky sides of the mountains and hills in
that desolate region of elevated plains, west of the fertile portions of Texas,
living amidst the solitude that wraps them in silence, far from enemies
and the busy haunts of men. In no instance have I met with this species
near any settlements. The wild, rocky hill-sides in the lone wilderness,
seem to be their favorite resort; and there, where trees are almost unknown,
and vegetation is scant, and where hardly a living thing is seen, are these
fine birds found in all their beauty and gentleness. The covies of them
showed but little alarm at our approach, and ran along over the rocks,
occasionally attempting to secrete themselves beneath them, in which case
they would let a person approach within a few feet. When startled by the
firing of a gun, they fly but a few yards before again alighting, and exhibit
little of that wildness peculiar to all the other species of partridges with
which I am acquainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1832 this bird was described under the name <i>Tetrao guttata</i>, by Don
Pablo de la Llave, in <i>Registro trimestre &oacute; coleccion de Memorias de
Historia, Literatura, Ciencas&oacute;y Artes</i>, Vol. I. p. 145, Mexico, 1832, which
periodical, though little known, and discontinued, we believe, before the
completion of the second volume, contains several valuable papers by this
and other Mexican authors, relative to the natural history of their country.
The ornithological papers by Sr. De la Llave, evince much ability, and
contain very accurate observations and descriptions; and a tone pervades
them too, which proclaims him to be a true lover of nature. That in which
we are interested at present, is entitled, &ldquo;Sobre tres especias neuvas del
genero <i>Tetrao</i>,&rdquo; and consists of notices of birds of this genus, of which he
had living specimens at his residence in the city of Mexico, and descriptions
of three species, viz.: <i>Tetrao marmorata</i> (which is <i>Ortyx macroura</i>, Jardine
and Selby), <i>T. cristata</i>, (which is <i>O. squamata</i>, Vigors.) and <i>T. guttata</i>,
(which is <i>O. Massena</i>, Lesson.)</p>
<p>To the last bird he thus alludes: &ldquo;It is only a few days since the third
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
species has been brought to me. It is rather smaller than the former, and
its deportment is entirely different. It carries its head habitually resting
upon its shoulders, the neck being excessively <i>small</i> and deflexed, and
in every thing it shows an amiability, and so to speak, a kindness of
character (<i>una bondad de caracter</i>) which is not found in any other
species of this genus, and it is naturally so tame and domestic as to
permit itself to be caught with the hand. These birds are always united,
forming a covey, and whenever one is separated, the others follow it; they
do not, like others, wish to sleep on elevated places, but sit on the ground,
drawing very near together. Their notes, which are not varied, are
very low and soft, and I have never heard loud cries from the male. When
they are frightened, they show much activity and swiftness; at other times
their gait and movement are habitually slow and deliberate, carrying the
crest puffed up (<i>esponjada</i>).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sr. De la Llave gives as the locality of his specimens, the warm regions
near the city of Mexico.</p>
<p>These statements comprise all that is known at present of the Massena
Partridge.</p>
<p>The contents of the crop in Capt. French&rsquo;s specimen consisted exclusively
of fragments of insects, pronounced by Dr. Leconte to be principally
grasshoppers, and a species of <i>Spectrum</i>. No trace whatever of food of a
vegetable character.</p>

<br />The White-Headed Gull.
<br />PLATE V.&mdash;Adult Male and Young female.</h2>
<p>Amongst the many species of sea-birds which frequent the coast of the
American continent on the Pacific ocean, there is a race of Gulls with very
graceful forms, slender and brightly colored bills, and handsome plumage,
of which no immediate representatives have yet been discovered on the
eastern shores of this continent. The range of the species of this race
extends from Oregon to Cape Horn, and one species similar in general
characters inhabits the coasts of Australia and some of the islands in the
Pacific ocean.</p>
<p>This group appears to be characterized generally by the uniform lead-colored
plumage which prevails in several of the known species, and seems
to embrace <i>Larus Belcheri</i>. Vigors. <i>Larus fuliginosus.</i> Gould. <i>Larus
nova hollandi&aelig;.</i> Stephens, the present species, and some others.</p>
<p>The bird, which is the subject of the present description, is one of the
most handsome of the numerous family to which it belongs, and of which
species are found on all the sea shores of the world. It is one of many
additions to the ornithological fauna of the United States, which have been
discovered by Adolphus L. Heermann, M. D., of Philadelphia, who has been
occupied for nearly three years in making researches and collections, with
excellent judgment and great enterprise, in California, and has now
succeeded in safely bringing home the most extensive collections ever made
in that country.</p>
<p>Dr. Heermann found this Gull occurring frequently on the coast of
California, but most numerous in the harbor of San Diego in the month of
March, at which time though it appeared to have attained its perfect
plumage in some instances, yet many specimens were clothed in that of
young birds. Both of these stages of plumage are represented in our
plate, and it is possible that the plumage assumed in winter, at all ages, may
be similar in most respects to that of the young.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>It was observed, at the localities alluded to, usually flying in company
with the western Gull, <i>Larus occidentalis</i>, Audubon, a large and handsome
species, of which, in a future part of our work, we hope to have the pleasure
of presenting a figure and description to our readers. It appeared to be
engaged in the capture of small fishes, of which several species abound in
the harbor of San Diego, and also appeared to feed on the small maritime
animals of various classes, that inhabit the immense beds of <i>Kelp</i> which
occur on the coast, and are especially extensive off the harbor of San
Diego less than a mile from its mouth.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> The nests and eggs of both the
present species and of the western Gull were found by Dr. Heermann on the
Coronadoes islands which are situated a short distance below the mouth of
the harbor.</p>
<p>Our first notice of this bird which we regard as having been previously
undescribed, and which we dedicated to its discoverer, is in the Proceedings
of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, Vol. VI. p. 187,
(October, 1852.) The figures given in the present plate are about one-sixth
of the natural size.</p>

<br />PLATE VI&mdash;Female.</h2>
<p>The study of the rapacious birds of western and north western America
presents great attractions to the ornithologist, and a wide field for discovery.</p>
<p>Owing, principally, to the difficulties in obtaining, or even in observing the
shy and vigilant birds of this family, their investigation is of peculiar character,
and dependent on accidental opportunity in some measure every where,
but especially in countries where the primitive forests yet flourish in undisturbed
vigour, and which abound in unexplored and, as yet, inaccessible
mountains; or in plains of an extent only known to the adventurous hunter,
and traversed only by the wandering Indian, or by the pioneers of civilization:
the devoted missionary, or the enterprising and hardy emigrant. Such
is the character of the regions of that portion of North America, the visits of
naturalists to which have been too transient to afford proper opportunities
for the study of the rapacious birds, and the detached items of information
which have appeared from time to time are not sufficiently numerous to be regarded
as giving any clear insight into their history.</p>
<p>The naturalist, generally travelling expeditiously with a military or other
party on business for the government, or with a caravan of emigrants, may
get a glimpse of a Falcon of singularly novel and beautiful plumage as it darts
away into concealment; or may see, occasionally, an Eagle seated at ease, and
viewing the novel cavalcade leisurely, but beyond the range of his rifle; or as
he performs, in turn, his assigned duty, and guards his sleeping companions
in the encampment, his watch-fire may attract clamorous night birds of strange
forms whose cries are unfamiliar to him, but to his practised ear may present
unmistakable family relationship, yet it is readily demonstrable that the
proper study of those birds requires facilities of a description only attainable
in the course of more protracted residence and frequently recurring opportunities.</p>
<p>The discovery in western America of the Californian Vulture, second in
size only to the great Condor of the Andes; of the Ferrugineous Buzzard,
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
<i>Archibuteo ferrugineus</i>, one of the handsomest of the American Falcons; of
the Burrowing Owl, a very remarkable species which lives in holes in the
ground; of the Little Californian Owl, <i>Athene infuscata</i>, the most diminutive
of its family yet discovered in the United States, and of other curious species,
may be regarded as affording an indication of the interesting results in this
group of birds which will reward the future labours of naturalists and travellers
in those vast and diversified regions.</p>
<p>The bird which is the subject of our present article is the largest and most
powerful of the Eagles. It is a native of the remote sea-coasts of northern
Asia and America, and has been especially observed in the group or girdle
of islands which extends from one continent to the other.</p>
<p>It also, very probably, extends its range into the interior of Russian America,
and possibly southward, in the winter season, into Oregon and California.
In size, and in the strength of its beak and talons, this gigantic Eagle far
surpasses any other of its tribe. The Golden Eagle, and the White-headed
Eagle, are comparatively insignificant; and if its habits correspond to its powerful
organization, as may safely be presumed, it is one of the most destructive
of the rapacious birds. It appears, however, like other species of its genus,
to prey principally on fishes, which are caught either by its own exertions, or
appropriated summarily by the right of the strongest, from the acquisitions
of more expert or more successful fishermen.</p>
<p>Though, like the White-headed or Bald Eagle, the range of this extraordinary
bird may be very extensive, yet the solitudes of the extreme northern
parts of the two continents appear to be its proper home; where, it has been
fully demonstrated, that although the resident animals of the land are necessarily
restricted in numbers, the sea teems with multitudes of inhabitants.
There, in the bleak regions of almost perpetual winter, the Great Sea Eagle
reigns, a mighty chieftain, without a competitor, and with power unrivalled:
finding ample subsistence in the arctic quadrupeds, and in the fishes of the
northern seas, or occasionally levying tribute from the hosts of feathered travellers
that make their annual pilgrimage to the places of their nativity, and
intrude on his domain. Even the famous Condor of the Andes, the largest
of Vultures, scarcely exceeds him in size, and in swiftness of flight, and power
of beak and talons, is much his inferior.</p>
<p>Pallas, a celebrated Russian naturalist, was the first who gave a satisfactory
and reliable account of this Eagle, in his Zoology of Asiatic Russia, I. p. 343,
(published at St. Petersburg in 1811, though printed many years previously,)
but it appears to have been previously noticed by the distinguished navigators,
Steller and Billings.</p>
<p>Before the time of Pallas, and, it may be added, since, also, various reports
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
of remarkable and sometimes very large Eagles having been seen in different
parts of America, were from time to time made by travellers and voyagers.
In fact, some are carefully and credibly described which are yet unknown to
naturalists. Capt. Cook, in the account of his last voyage, or rather in that
part of it which was written by himself, states that several Eagles, one of
which is very remarkable, were seen at Kayes&rsquo; Island, on the northwest coast
of America, in latitude 59&deg; 49&prime; N. &ldquo;We saw,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;flying about the
woods, a Crow, two or three of the white-headed Eagles, mentioned at Nootka,
and another sort full as large, which appeared also of the same colour, or
blacker, and had only <i>a white breast</i>.&rdquo; Last Voyage, II. p. 352, quarto,
London, 1784. It is necessary for me to say only, that no species of Eagle
having a white breast is yet known as an inhabitant of any part of America.</p>
<p>In the History of the Expedition of Lewis and Clarke it is stated, that
&ldquo;The Calumet Eagle sometimes inhabits this side of the Rocky mountains.
The colours are black and white, beautifully variegated. The tail feathers,
so highly prized by the natives, are composed of twelve broad feathers of unequal
length, which are white except within two inches of their extremities,
when they immediately change to a jetty black, the <i>wings</i> have each a large
circular <i>white spot</i> in the middle, which is only visible when they are extended.&rdquo;
II. p. 188, Philada., 1814. This statement, though it appears to
have been usually regarded as referring to the Golden Eagle, does not apply
to any established species, but it is worth bearing in mind that in the number
of the feathers of the tail, the bird here alluded to agrees exactly with Audubon&rsquo;s
Washington Eagle, (Orn. Biog. I. p. 63.)</p>
<p>The black-checked Eagle of Pennant, said to be from North America, (Arctic
Zoology, I. p. 227,) and which is <i>Falco americanus</i>, Gmelin, is described
as being &ldquo;about the size of the Golden Eagle, but with the head, neck and
breast of a <i>deep ash colour</i>, each cheek marked with a broad black bar, passing
from the corner of the mouth beyond the ears; back, belly, wings and tail,
black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable of these mysterious birds is the White Eagle,
represented by Du Pratz as inhabiting Louisiana, of whose description of
which the following is a translation: &ldquo;The Eagle, the king of birds, is smaller
than the Eagle of the Alps, but it is much handsomer, being <i>almost entirely
white</i>, and having only the extremities of its wings black. As it is rather
rare, this is a second reason for rendering it esteemed amongst the people of
the country, who buy at a high price the feathers of its wings to make the
ornament of the symbol of peace, and which is the fan of which I have spoken
in giving a description of the Calumet.&rdquo; Du Pratz, Histoire de la Louisiane,
II. p. 109, Paris, 1758. On the faith of this description, the species supposed
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
to be alluded to has been named <i>Falco candidus</i> by Gmelin. If not an albino,
there is a possibility that it is a species of a group of white hawks, of rather
large size, which are principally found in South America, and one species of
which (<i>Buteo Ghiesbrect&uuml; Dubus</i>,) is known to inhabit Mexico. The latter
would agree very well with Du Pratz&rsquo;s description, so far as it goes.</p>
<p>That excellent and reliable naturalist, the Prince Maximilian of Wied,
whose Travels in the interior of North America contain much valuable information
in nearly all departments of Zoology, mentions a &ldquo;Grey Eagle of
enormous dimensions,&rdquo; I. pp. 203, 214, (Raise in das innere Nord-America,
Quarto, Coblenz, 1839.)<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>But there is no end to the accounts of strange Eagles given by travellers
and naturalists. Some of them may have reference to peculiar species which
have in later times escaped attention, but the probability is, that they more
frequently allude to accidental varieties, or that the authors describe from such
reports as they had heard at second hand, or fell into error from insufficient
personal observation.</p>
<p>Several of the naturalists who have recently visited California have informed
us that they saw occasionally large species of Eagles, or other large
rapacious birds, of which they did not succeed in procuring specimens, nor in
approaching within sufficiently short distance to be enabled to examine them
satisfactorily.</p>
<p>We have introduced the extraordinary bird which is the subject of our
present article, thus early into our work, for the purpose mainly of asking attention
to a most remarkable and interesting species heretofore apparently
entirely unknown to American Ornithological writers, and also on account of
its similarity, in some respects, to one of the most important of Audubon&rsquo;s
discoveries, the Washington Eagle. This celebrated author was not acquainted
with the bird now before us.</p>
<p>The specimen of the Washington Eagle, described and figured by Audubon,
does not appear to have been preserved, or at any rate is not known to be
extant, nor does it appear that he ever procured more than one. His drawing,
however, with some others of species which he had met with but once,
appears fortunately to have escaped the destruction of his collection of pictures
of birds by rats, as described in his Ornithological Biography, Vol. I. Introductory
Address, p. 13, (Edinburg edition, 1831.)</p>
<p>We have no doubt that such a species exists, or in other words, that Audubon
is entirely correct in regarding his bird as a peculiar species; and we
think it quite impossible for his description and history to apply to the young
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
of the common White-headed or Bald Eagle, as has been supposed by some
American, and by nearly all late European Ornithologists. But we are disposed,
at present, to question the correctness of his plate, and also his statement
that the bird represented was an &ldquo;adult male&rdquo; (Orn. Biog. I. p. 62).
We are aware, of course, that the plate may not be a fair representation of
the drawing, and in fact it has not been very carefully engraved. The tail
appears to be unfinished. Having, however, quite sufficient knowledge of the
difficulties in getting up correct plates of birds, we are enabled fully to appreciate
the disadvantages under which this distinguished Ornithologist, with all
his artistic knowledge and perseverance, must necessarily have laboured at the
commencement of his great work, and his plate of the Washington Eagle is
one of the earliest, being the eleventh of the series.</p>
<p>The bill, as represented in the plate, is shorter than we have ever seen in
any adult Eagle of this group (the fishing Eagles), and above all the arrangement
of the scales on the tarsi anteriorly, is such as we have never observed
in any rapacious bird whatever.</p>
<p>Notices of the Washington Eagle having been captured, have appeared
occasionally (as in Nuttal&rsquo;s Manuel, I. p. 71, and the Boston Journal of Nat.
Hist. III. p. 72), and we have seen numerous specimens of Eagles of a size
so large that they could not, without much doubt, be referred to the common
white-headed species. But we have never seen nor heard of a specimen which
presented all the peculiar characters represented in Audubon&rsquo;s plate, and
especially the anterior scales of the tarsus continued transversely so far down
to the toes. The pointed and slender feathers of the neck, the large size, and
in one specimen of a young bird, the short bill we have seen, and there are
specimens now in the collection of the Philadelphia Academy in which these
characters will be found, but not the peculiar arrangement of the scales of
the tarsus. All other species of fishing Eagles have the head more or less
marked with white in their mature plumage. In Audubon&rsquo;s plate of the
Washington Eagle, the head is of the same deep brown as the other parts.
From analogy, therefore, it may safely be presumed that he was mistaken in
supposing his specimen to be that of an adult male bird.</p>
<p>An interesting feature in the large specimens to which we allude, is the
fact that they almost invariably have the ends of their tails broken as though
injured by alighting habitually on rocks, or on the ground, thus apparently
confirming Audubon&rsquo;s statements. Young birds are however peculiarly liable
to such injury on account of their feathers not possessing the strength and
rigidity of more mature plumage.</p>
<p>Respecting the Washington Eagle, our conclusion is, therefore, after many
years of attention to American birds, and especially to obscure or little known
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
species, that of the existence of such a species in North America as is described
by Audubon, in Ornithological Biography, I. p. 58, there can be no reasonable
doubt. But we are of opinion that when adult it is very probably a bird
with the head more or less white, and tail of the same colour; and we are
disposed to regard the plate in Birds of America as erroneous, for reasons
above intimated, or for others not at present demonstrable, and at all events
as representing a young specimen. Waiving the presence of the character
of the scales of the tarsi as above stated, we think that we have several times
seen the young of the Washington Eagle, and that specimens of it are now in
the collection of the Philadelphia Academy. It is not, however, so large as
the immense Eagle which in the present article, and accompanying plate, we
have the pleasure of presenting to the American public for the first time, but
it appears to us to be more nearly related to it than to any other species.</p>
<p>The Eagle mentioned in the History of the Expedition of Lewis and Clarke,
as cited in a preceding page, we are inclined to suspect to be the present
species, but should not be surprised if it should be ascertained by succeeding
naturalists to be the adult of the Washington Eagle.</p>
<p>The great Eagle now before us has never been observed as yet by an
American voyager, and few specimens only are contained in European museums.
The only specimen in the United States is that in the collection of
the Philadelphia Academy from which the drawing was made for the present
plate.</p>
<p>We have added as a suitable conclusion of our present article a translation
of the original account of this Eagle as given by Pallas, and which will be
found in his Zoology of Asiatic Russia, as cited above:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steller, worthy of a better fate, first observed this remarkable species,
and in his manuscripts briefly described it. Now, also, I have before me an
elegantly prepared specimen from my friend Billings, who, with the last navigator,
explored the ocean between Kamschatka and America. This very large
bird is frequent in the islands between Kamschatka and the American continent,
especially in the islands noted for the unfortunate shipwreck and death
of Bering. It appears very rarely in Kamschatka itself. In the highest rocks
overhanging the sea, it constructs a nest of two ells in diameter, composed of
twigs of fruit and other trees, gathered from a great distance, and strewed
with grass in the centre, in which are one or two eggs, in form, magnitude and
whiteness, very like those of a Swan. The young is hatched in the beginning
of June, and has an entirely white woolly covering. While Steller was cautiously
viewing such a nest from a precipice, the parents darted with such
unforeseen impetuosity as nearly to throw him headlong; the female having
been wounded, both flew away, nor did they return to the nest which was
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
watched for two days. But, as if lamenting, they often sat on an opposite
rock. It is a kind of bird, bold, very cunning, circumspect, observant, and
of savage disposition. Steller saw a Fox (<i>Vulpes lagopodus</i>) carried off by
one and dashed upon the rocks, and afterwards torn in pieces. It lives also
on dead substances cast up by the sea, and various offscourings of the ocean.&rdquo;</p>

<br />The Ground Wren.
<br />PLATE VII.&mdash;Adult Male.</h2>
<p>This little bird was discovered in California, by William Gambel, M. D.,
an enthusiastic and highly talented young naturalist, who, during an overland
journey across the North American Continent, made many discoveries, and
added much valuable information to several departments of Natural History,
and we regret to say, whose recent death, during a second expedition of the
same character, occurring, as it did, so early, and thus terminating so prematurely
a life of such promise, is to be deplored as a loss to science and to his
country.</p>
<p>Dr. Gambel&rsquo;s account of this bird in the Proceedings of the Academy of
Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, II. p. 265, and in the Journal of the same
society, quarto, I. p. 34, which is the first and, as yet, the most satisfactory,
is as follows: &ldquo;For several months before discovering the bird, I was attracted
in the fields of dead mustard stalks, the weedy margins of streams, low thickets
and bushy places, by a continued loud, crepitant, grating scold, which
I took for that of a species of Wren, but at last found it to proceed from this
Wren-tit, if it may be so called. It was difficult to be seen, and kept in such
places as I have described, close to the ground; eluding pursuit by diving
into the thickest bunches of weeds and tall grass, or tangled bushes, and
uttering its grating Wren-like notes whenever approached. But if quietly,
watched, it may be seen, when searching for insects, mounting the twigs and
dried stalks of grass sideways, jerking its long tail, and holding it erect like
a Wren, which, with its short wings in such a position, it much resembles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes it utters a slow, monotonous, singing chicadee note, like <i>pee,
pee, pee, pee, peep</i>; at other times its notes are varied, and a slow whistling
continued <i>pwit, pwit, pwit, pwit</i>, is heard. Again, in pleasant weather,
towards spring, I have heard individuals answering each other, singing in a
less solemn strain not unlike sparrows, a lively <i>pit, pit, pit, tr, r, r, r, r, r</i>,
but, if disturbed, they at once resumed their usual scold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bell, whose collection contained numerous specimens of this bird, found
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
it abundant in the neighbourhood of San Francisco, and has kindly allowed
us to use his memoranda: &ldquo;I observed this bird in bushes and briers every
where along the roads, and in brush heaps on lands which had been recently
cleared, though it appeared rather to prefer damp places. It was very pert,
and not easily frightened, and as it moved about with its tail erect, uttered
several rather peevish notes, unlike those of any other bird with which I am
acquainted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The white iris of this bird, when in its native haunts, is quite readily
observed, and with its manners and the localities which it frequents, reminded
me, in some measure, of the white-eyed Vireo, (<i>V. noveboracensis</i>.) Its skin
is unusually strong for such a small bird, and it has a remarkable development
of the muscles of the thighs, and, in fact, unusual strength and firmness
of the muscular system generally.&rdquo;</p>

<br />The Hooded Oriole.
<br />PLATE VIII.&mdash;Male and Female.</h2>
<p>Some of the most beautiful of the American Orioles are inhabitants of
Mexico. Of these, we present, in the plate now before the reader, one of
the smallest of the species, which, though it cannot compete with many others
of its more richly coloured relatives, is still entitled to make considerable
claims. The various shades of the richest yellow colours are almost exhausted
in the splendid species of these birds which are found in Mexico, and in South
America, and as an accompaniment to the luxuriant vegetation of those countries,
they form, necessarily, a most agreeable and interesting feature.</p>
<p>The birds of this family represented in the northern portion of this continent,
by the Baltimore Oriole, are remarkable for their skill in constructing
elaborately formed and pendent nests, frequently of large size. Several of
the South American species make them of grasses, intricately and substantially
woven, and shaped like a purse or bag, with the entrance sometimes
from the top, but more frequently ingeniously inserted in the side, near the
lower end. They are usually suspended from the pendent branches of trees,
and often near the habitations of men. The Baltimore Oriole builds a nest
sufficiently similar to afford an idea of the general character of the nests of
these birds, but those of several of the southern species are much more artfully
and elaborately constructed.</p>
<p>The handsome little bird at present before us, was first described from
Mexican specimens, by Mr. Swainson, in the Philosophical Magazine, 1827,
p. 436, (London.) It is an inhabitant, also, of Texas, where it was repeatedly
observed by our friends Col. McCall and Capt. McCown, the latter of
which gentlemen has most kindly communicated the following with other
valuable notices:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This beautiful Oriole is quite common on the Rio Grande, where it raises
its young. When met with in the woods, and far away from man&rsquo;s abode, it
is shy, and seems rather disposed to conceal itself, yet a pair were constant
visitors, morning and evening, to the vicinity of my quarters (an unfinished
building at Ringgold Barracks, Texas.) They became so tame and familiar
that they would pass from some ebony trees that stood near by, to the porch,
clinging to the shingles and rafters, frequently in an inverted position, prying
into the holes and crevices, apparently in search of such insects as could be
found there, which, I believe, were principally spiders. They would sometimes
desist for a moment from this occupation, to observe my movements,
and if I happened to be enjoying a cigar after dinner, seemed to watch the
smoke with great curiosity. I often offered them such hospitality as was in
my power, but could never induce them to touch any food, in which respect
they were very different from the large black birds, whose acquaintance I
also cultivated. I have seen the nests of this species, but never had an opportunity
to examine them.&rdquo;</p>

<br />Gambel&rsquo;s Partridge.
<br />PLATE IX.&mdash;Male and Young Female.</h2>
<p>Mexico and the adjacent parts of the United States are particularly productive
of game birds, and amongst them are several species of Partridges,
unrivalled in beauty of plumage by those of any other country of the world.
Of those, some prefer fertile valleys, or grounds under cultivation; others
appear to live almost entirely in the barren plains, or in the mountains.</p>
<p>Independently of the usefulness of those birds as food, to the citizens of
the States alluded to, and to those who, in future years, shall occupy with
their farms and homesteads districts yet unpeopled, the numerous game birds
must always be a source of constant interest and amusement. Like the Deer,
and like the Turkey, Grouse, and Partridge of other States, their pursuit is
not only an easily attainable amusement, but serves also for the cultivation of
a knowledge of, and expertness in the use of firearms, which are peculiarly
characteristic of our vigorous and successful population, and have contributed
in an important degree to the formation of the character of the world-renowned
citizen-soldier of the United States.</p>
<p>Experience in hunter life, and the incidental influences of its occupations
and associations, are no inconsiderable features in American education; and
the invigorating and healthful pursuits of the youthful hunter or trapper have
always appeared to us to be no unimportant agents in the development of his
physical and of his intellectual constitution. In large portions of every State
of the Union, the gun or the rifle is the favourite companion of almost every
boy from the earliest period of his competency for its management; and we
have seen abundant instances, in our early days, of very considerably forced
presumption of competency. In fact, the stranger, in very many of the rural
districts of the United States, might almost be tempted to conclude that the
famous ancient formula of early education had been adopted, with an addition:
&ldquo;Learn to speak the truth and to swim&rdquo;&mdash;and to shoot.</p>
<p>The beautiful Partridge now before us was discovered a few years since in
New Mexico, by Dr. William Gambel, in honor of whom it has been named.
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
The first description of it is in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural
Sciences of Philadelphia, I. p. 260, April, 1843, and afterwards was reprinted
in the Journal of the same society, I. p. 219, (Quarto.)</p>
<p>Since that period it has repeatedly been observed, and we have now the
gratification of being able to present to our readers a particular history of
this fine species.</p>
<p>Our friend, Captain S. G. French, of the United States Army, to whose
kindness we have previously been indebted, has favoured us with the following
interesting account:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This species was found by me on the Rio Grande, some seventy miles
below El Paso; and from that point to the place just mentioned, the numbers
constantly increased. They seem to be partial to the abodes of man, and are
very numerous about the old and decayed buildings, gardens, fields, and vineyards
around Presidio, Isileta, and El Paso. During my stay there in the
summer of 1851, every morning and evening their welcome call was heard
around us, and at those early and late hours they were constantly to be found
in the sandy roads and paths near the villages and farms. In the middle of
the hot summer days, they rest in the sand, under the shade and protection
of the thick <i>chapparal</i>; and, when disturbed, they glide through the bushes
very swiftly, seldom resorting to flight, and uttering all the while a peculiar
chirping note, by which they appear to be enabled to keep together. The
parent birds would utter the same chirp whenever I endeavoured to capture
their young. The male and female were always found with the young birds,
and showed much affection for them, even endeavoring to attract my attention
to themselves by their actions and cries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Col. George A. McCall, the accuracy of whose knowledge of the birds of
Western America is unrivalled, gives an interesting account of this bird in his
&ldquo;Remarks on the habits, &amp;c., of Birds met with in Western Texas, between
San Antonio and the Rio Grande, and in New Mexico,&rdquo; published in the Proceedings
of the Philadelphia Academy, V. p. 213, (June, 1851):</p>
<p>&ldquo;After losing sight of the Massena Partridge, I did not fall in with the
present species until we reached the Limpia river, about 100 miles west of
the Pecos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This beautiful bird, whose habits, in some respects, bear resemblance to
the common partridge, like that, seems to prefer a more genial and hospitable
region. In this part of the country, the Mesquite tree (Acacia glandulosa)
is more or less common; and the Mesquite grass, and other plants bearing
nutritious seeds, are abundant. Here, this partridge increases rapidly in
numbers, and becomes very fat; and, as I afterwards ascertained, is much
disposed to seek the farms, if any be within reach, and to cultivate the
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
acquaintance of man. About the rancho of Mr. White, near El Paso, I found
them very numerous; and here, in flocks of fifty or a hundred, they resort,
morning and evening, to the barn-yard, and feed around the grain stacks, in
company with the poultry, where they receive their portion, as it is scattered
amongst them by the hand of the owner. I found them distributed through
the country from the Limpia to the Rio Grande, a range from east to west
exceeding one hundred miles; and along the Rio Grande, from Eagle Spring
Pass to Don Ana, a distance of one hundred and twenty miles. North of
this I did not see them. I was not among them during the season of incubation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the most comprehensive and complete account ever before published of
this Partridge, has been furnished by the same gentleman (Col. McCall) for
insertion into our present article; for which, and for many other similar favours
from him, we beg to tender our deep sense of obligation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whilst in California, during the last summer, (1852,) I was enabled to
ascertain the western limit of this species as satisfactorily as I had previously
ascertained its eastern limit within the State of Texas. And, although the
extent of its range to the north is not yet clearly established, it may be said
that the portion of our territory inhabited by this beautiful bird is a rather
narrow belt of country, (say one thousand miles long by two hundred
broad,) embraced between the 31st and 34th parallels of north latitude, and
extending from the Pecos river in Texas to the Sierra Nevada and the contiguous
desert in California. Be it understood, however, that when I speak
of a narrow belt of country along a certain parallel, I do not intend to say
that the <i>habitat</i> of the species does not extend beyond this belt into <i>Mexico</i>;
but that the river Gila being our southern boundary through the greater part
of the region referred to, the portion of our own territory inhabited by this
bird is confined to such a belt as I have indicated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, then, with respect to its western limit. This species was discovered
by Dr. Gambel, &lsquo;on the eastern side of the Californian range of mountains,
in 1841.&rsquo; He did not meet with it on the western side; nor has it, as far as
made known, been found there since that time by others. During the last
summer, search was made for it by several gentlemen who were interested in
the subject, as well as by myself, in different localities from north to south
along the Pacific slope, but in every instance without success. Hence, the
inference must be that this Partridge has never crossed to the west of the
Sierra, where, as we well know, it is abundantly replaced by the closely allied
species, the &lsquo;<i>California Partridge</i>.&rsquo; Following down the Sierra Nevada to
its junction with the coast-range, you come upon a desert of sand of vast
extent; and as the snowy peaks of the Sierra had stopped the march of this
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
species above, so did the burning sands of the desert stop its progress below,
and effectually shut it out from the Pacific plain. It is true I found it at
<i>Alamo macho</i> (cottonwood grove), which is 44 miles west of the Colorado
river. Thus far it had penetrated into the dreary waste, and had managed
to find shelter and subsistence where there is little to support animal life.
But from this <i>oasis</i> to <i>Valle-cita</i> (little valley), it is seventy miles. In this
interval, a vast ocean of sand presents a formidable barrier, as is but too
plainly indicated by the bleached bones of horses and mules scattered along
the route&mdash;and this barrier effectually separates the two congenerous species
of partridge: the range of <i>Gambel&rsquo;s Partridge</i> being confined to the east of
this desert, while the range of the <i>California Partridge</i> is confined to the
west of it&mdash;although on both sides they approach to the very edge, as I ascertained
from personal observation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the second place, with respect to its eastern limit&mdash;I have to repeat
that I did not meet with this species in Texas, either in going or returning,
anywhere east of the Pecos river; nor was it found by either of three other
parties who explored those regions, both previously and subsequently, until
after they had passed to the west of that river. Here, again, a sandy desert,
between the Pecos and Devil&rsquo;s river, is the barrier beyond which the species
under consideration has not extended its range to the eastward; and, as it is
replaced beyond the Sierra and the desert in the west by the <i>California
Partridge</i>, so is it replaced beyond the Pecos in the east by the <i>Massena
Partridge</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With regard to the northern and southern limits of this species, less is
known. I found it in 1850, on the Limpia creek, in N. Lat. 31&deg;&mdash;thence to
the Rio Grande, and up that river to Don Ana, Lat. 33&deg;. But I found it
nowhere beyond that point, either near the river or among the hills as far
back as the foot of the Sierra de los Mimbres, and I passed up and down
between El Paso and Santa Fe at different seasons of the year; yet through
all this country I met with the <i>Blue Partridge</i> (C. squamata). The species
in question, however, is known to be abundant in the country around the
sources of the Gila river. It has also been found along that river, from the
Pimo villages to its mouth; and there is no doubt it inhabits the entire valley
of the Gila. It was common along the Colorado river, as far up as Camp
Yuma (mouth of Gila), and it has been met with in that valley as high up as
Yampai creek, N. Lat. 34&deg;, but I have no information of its having been found
north of that parallel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The habits of this species are, in most respects, similar to those of the
California Partridge; but it has always appeared to me less vigilant and wild.
I was not so fortunate, however, as to discover its nest; nor did I gather from
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
others any information as to its eggs&mdash;their colour or their markings. I frequently
heard the call or song of the male bird during the period of nesting,
which, from some cause or other not apparent to me, was later than that of its
congener. As early as June 4th, I found covies of the young of the <i>California
Partridge</i> large enough to fly&mdash;say one-fourth grown; whilst all the birds of
this species (and I saw many,) as late as June 16th, were still without their
young. But the voice of the male, as I was about to remark, is, at this
season, strikingly rich and full. A very good idea may be formed of his cry
by slowly pronouncing, in a low tone, the syllables &lsquo;<i>kaa-wale</i>,&rsquo; &lsquo;<i>kaa-wale</i>.&rsquo;
These notes, when uttered close at hand, are by no means loud; yet it is perfectly
astonishing to what a distance they may be heard when the day is calm
and still. There was to me something extremely plaintive in this simple love-song,
which I heard for the first time during a day of burning heat passed
upon the desert. I had reached the well at <i>Alamo mucho</i> before noon, and
had halted to rest my jaded mules after their toilsome march. Here is, in
truth, a desert!&mdash;figure to yourself, if you can, a portion of this fair earth,
where, for some hundreds of miles, the whole crust seems to have been reduced
to ashes by the action of internal fires; behold a vast plain of desolation, surrounded,
and, at intervals, intersected by abrupt mountain ranges, which are
little better than gigantic heaps of scoria; imagine this scenery to be actually
glowing under the direct rays of a midsummer sun, and you may have some
idea of the prospect that meets the eye of the traveller who looks out upon
the desert from the well of the Alamo. You may perceive in his rear a few
stunted cottonwood-trees scattered along the edge of a channel, in which,
apparently, water once <i>was</i>, but now is not; whilst around him, here and
there, is a light-leafed mesquite that stretches forth its slender arms, and
appears to invite him to a shade which is but a mockery. Here it was that I
first heard the plaintive voice of this bird as he strove to cheer his mate whilst
occupied in the tedious task of incubation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had passed the hours of noon stretched upon the sand near the well: the
thermometer, in the best shade to be obtained, indicating a temperature of 140&deg;
to 150&deg;, (<i>Fahrenheit</i>); and as the sun began to decline towards the horizon,
the first wakeful sound of animal life that greeted my ear was the soft &lsquo;<i>kaa-wale</i>,&rsquo;
&lsquo;<i>kaa-wale</i>,&rsquo; of this beautiful bird. I turned towards a cluster of mesquite,
at the distance of some two hundred yards from which the call seemed to come,
but could discern no object in motion. This song was continued, at short
intervals, for about an hour; when, at last, one of the birds came forth upon
the sand, and was soon followed by its mate. They ran lightly over the sand,
and glided into the gully, where they began to search for their evening meal.
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
I followed with my gun and secured them both&mdash;they were a male and female,
the skins of which I have preserved. This was June 8th.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later in the season, when a covey is dispersed, the cry for assembling is
&lsquo;<i>qua-el</i>,&rsquo; &lsquo;<i>qua-el</i>.&rsquo; The voice at all seasons bears much resemblance to that
of the <i>California Partridge</i>&mdash;having, in its intonation, no similarity to the
whistle of the Virginia or common partridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crops of those killed at the Alamo, and thence to the Colorado, were
filled with the leaves of the mesquite, which seemed to be their principal food,
though in some were found remains of coleopterous insects. In some of those
killed near the river I found the wild gooseberry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dimensions of this species, given by Gould in his &lsquo;Odontophorin&aelig;,&rsquo;
are, (? skin) length 9&frac34; inches; wing, 4&frac12;; tail, 4. By Dr. Gambel, (Proc.
Acad. Nat. Sci., Philada., I. p. 260,) length, over 10 inches; wing, 4&frac12;;
tail, 4&frac12;.</p>

when killed):</p>

<p>The identical pair of birds alluded to in this excellent and satisfactory
history is represented in our plate; and the specimens, with many others
collected by this gentleman, are now in the collection of the Philadelphia
Academy.</p>
<p>Fine specimens of this bird are also now in the national collection at
Washington, and were collected by Dr. Woodhouse, while attached to the
party under command of Captain Sitgreaves, which surveyed the rivers Zunia
and the Colorado of the west.</p>

Dr. Gambel himself, without allusion to his learned friend and patron,
Mr. Nuttall, as joint author, editor, or otherwise. Nevertheless, as we
happen to know that that distinguished gentleman did furnish the specific
name in question, and others in the paper alluded to, we, for the present,
acquiesce in the citation of his name. But under no circumstances can this
method be allowed as a general principle. No person is the authority for
a species unless he is the first to publish a description of it, and the citing
of a name as the authority for a species ought always to be based on that
fact, the neglect of which has caused much difficulty and confusion in
zoological nomenclature.</p>

<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">BERNICLA NIGRICANS.&mdash;(Lawrence.)</span>
<br />The Black Brant.
<br />PLATE X.&mdash;Adult Male.</h2>
<p>This is a very remarkable and distinct species of Brant, first noticed by our
esteemed friend Mr. George N. Lawrence, an Ornithologist of great ability
and accuracy, of the city of New York. It was described by him in a paper
read before the Lyceum of Natural History of that city, and published in its
Annals, IV. p. 171, (1846.)</p>
<p>Mr. Lawrence states in the paper alluded to: &ldquo;I have taken the above
description and figure from an adult female, procured at Egg Harbour,
N. J., in January. Since then two others have been obtained at the same
place, one of which I have in my possession. On dissection it proved to be a
male. It agrees in markings with the female, but is evidently a younger bird,
being somewhat lighter in the colour of its plumage. From this, I infer, they
become darker by age. It is a little larger than the female, the bill being
also stouter, measuring seven-eighths of an inch high at the base.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When on a shooting excursion some years since at Egg Harbour, I noticed
a bird flying at some distance from us, which our gunner said was a Black
Brant. This was the first intimation I had of such a bird. Upon further
inquiry, he informed me that he had seen them occasionally, but that they were
not common. I have learned from Mr. P. Brasier, who has passed much time
at that place, that, speaking to the gunners about them, they said they were
well known by the name of Black Brant, and one of them mentioned having
once seen a flock of five or six together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From these facts it appears to be known to gunners, but has heretofore
escaped the notice of Ornithologists. With all my inquiries I have not been
able to procure a specimen before this winter. I think it a good and well
marked species.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have had the pleasure of seeing the specimen described by Mr. Lawrence,
and entirely coincide with him in his conclusion. It is precisely similar
to others that have come under our notice, and all presenting the same peculiar
specific characters.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>To the gunners of Philadelphia this bird is known by the same name, and
we have seen several specimens which have been shot in Delaware Bay, and
at various points on the sea-coast. Our friend Mr. John Krider, Gunsmith,
whose establishment is a favourite place of resort of the Ornithologists and
gunners of this city, and who is well acquainted with American birds, and
very successful in obtaining specimens of rare species, has had several specimens
of this Brant brought to him within the last two or three years.
It must, however, be considered as a species of rather unusual occurrence on
the Atlantic coast, but perhaps not more so than the Snow Goose, and others
which are well known. As is the case with the birds just mentioned, it is
probable, too, that the migration of this Brant does not commonly reach so
far southward as the latitude of either of the large cities on the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Several species of Geese, which appear to be unknown to Naturalists, have
been noticed by travellers in various parts of North America, but especially
in the northern and Arctic regions. Of these we shall give an account, somewhat
in detail in a succeeding article; at present, we are acquainted with one
allusion only, which we think it not improbable has reference to the species
now before us. It is in Sir John Richardson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Arctic Searching Expedition,&rdquo;
a journal of a Boat voyage through Rupert&rsquo;s land and the Arctic Sea,
in search of the discovery ships under command of Sir John Franklin, London,
1851, New York, 1852. In citing an account of the valley of the Yukon
river, in about lat. 66&deg; north, long. 147&deg; west, contained in a letter to him
from Mr. Murray, a resident in that country, the following statements occur
(American edition, p. 305): &ldquo;White Geese (Snow Geese, <i>Chen hyperboreus</i>)
are also passengers here; and there are likewise <i>Black Geese</i>, which I presume
you have never seen. A few of them pass down Peel&rsquo;s River, but they are
more abundant on the Yukon. They are very handsome birds, considerably
smaller than the White Geese, and have a dark brown or brownish black
colour, with <i>a white ring round the neck</i>, the head and bill having the shape
of that of the Bustard (the Canada Goose, <i>Anser Canadensis</i>). The Black
Geese are the least numerous, and the latest that arrive here. They fly in
large flocks with remarkable velocity, and generally pass on without remaining
as the others do, some days to feed. When they alight, it is always in
the water; and if they wish to land, they swim ashore. They are very fat,
and their flesh has an oily and rather disagreeable taste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bustards, Laughing Geese, Ducks, and large Gulls, make their appearance
here from the 27th to the 29th of April; Snow Geese and Black Geese
about the 15th or 16th of May, when the other kinds become plentiful. They
have mostly passed by the end of the month, though some, especially the Bustards,
are seen in June. The White Geese and Black Geese breed only on
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
the shores of the Arctic Sea. They return in September, and early in
October, flying high, and seldom halting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John Richardson seems inclined to the opinion that the common Brant
is here alluded to; which, however, we cannot consider so probable as that it
is our present bird. So well acquainted with the water birds of Europe and
America as he is, it could scarcely have been supposed by Mr. Murray that
he had never seen so abundant a species as the common Brant. Besides, the
white ring round the neck, as described, is exactly applicable to the Black
Brant now before us, and its uniting on the front of the neck forms a peculiar
character sufficient to distinguish it from any other species.</p>

other in their habits, and the two South American species are nearly related
to similar species of the North, as will be pointed out in descriptions of the
latter now to be given. In all its essential characters, this genus differs very
little from <i>Sarcoramphus</i>, which includes the <i>Condor</i> and the <i>King Vulture</i>
of South America.</p>

or bent suddenly down, and sharp; the head and neck bare of feathers nearly down to the
stomach, when the feathers begin to cover the skin, and soon become long and of a soft texture,
forming a ruff or tippet, in which the bird, by contracting his neck, can hide that as well as
his head; the bare skin on the neck appears loose and wrinkled, which is of a bright yellow
colour, intermixed with coral red; the hinder part of the neck is nearly covered with short stiff
hair; and the skin of this part of the neck is of a dun purple colour, gradually becoming red
as it approaches the yellow of the sides and forepart. The crown of the head is red; there are
lobed lappets of a reddish orange colour, which lay on the base of the upper mandible. The
plumage of the bird is generally white or cream colour, except the quill feathers of the wings
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
and two or three rows of the coverts, which are beautiful dark brown; the tail, which is rather

<p><span class="sc">Obs.</span> The identification of the bird here described, may be considered as
one of the most important services to be performed in North American Ornithology.
Its occurrence has never been noticed since the time of the accurate
and veracious naturalist who first described it, and his careful description
above quoted seems to clearly indicate it to be a species entirely unknown.
The white tail especially is characteristic, and establishes a clear distinction
from any other known species. It is related evidently to the King Vulture,
(<i>S. papa</i>,) but that species has a black tail, and in case of mistake or misprint
in Bartram&rsquo;s description, it may be presumed at any rate to relate to an occurrence
of that species within the United States. There is no more inviting
nor more singular problem in North American Ornithology.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Obs.</span> The famous Condor of the Andes, though it has been admitted as a
North American bird into the works of Bonaparte and Nuttall, cannot at
present, in our opinion, be so regarded. The description in the History of
the Expedition of Lewis and Clarke, which was supposed to relate to this bird,
and has been the sole authority for its introduction by the authors just mentioned,
very probably applies to the Californian Vulture. No other travellers
have seen the Condor, either at the localities mentioned by Lewis and Clarke,
or elsewhere in North America. It is common in the western parts of South
America. The most complete descriptions with which we are acquainted are
by Humboldt, in Zoological Observations, I. p. 26, (Recuil d&rsquo;Observationes

</blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">Obs.</span> The King Vulture is the most handsome bird of its family. Though
admitted by Nuttall as a bird of the United States (Manuel, I. p. 40, Boston,
1840,) no instance is recorded, or has otherwise come to our knowledge, of
its having been observed north of Mexico. It is not improbable, however,
that it may yet be found in Texas or in California, or possibly in Florida.
It is described by Hernandez as an inhabitant of Mexico, in his &ldquo;New History
of the Plants, Animals, and Minerals of Mexico,&rdquo; p. 319, (Nova, plantarum,
animalium et mineralium Mexicanorum, Historia, Rome, 1651, folio,) and has
found a place in the works of all authors on general Ornithology, and been
noticed by many travellers.</p>
<p>The above comprise all the Vultures which have been hitherto known or
supposed to inhabit America, north of Mexico. There are three other species
which appear to be peculiar to South America and the islands of West Indies,
(particularly the more southern of them,) all of which more or less intimately
resemble our species of the North. They are <i>Cathartes jota</i> (Molina), described
in Geog. Nat. and Civil Hist. of Chili, American edition, I. p. 185, (Middletown
Conn. 1808, octavo,) <i>Cathartes Brasiliensis</i>, Bonaparte Consp. Av. p. 9,
and <i>Cathartes urbicola</i>, Des Murs Rev. and Mag. de Zool. April, 1853. The
latter is a large and very remarkable species which has only recently been
ascertained to frequent the cities of several of the West Indies.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the American Vultures are remarkable for a disposition manifested,
in a greater or less degree, to resort to cities, or even more isolated
abodes of men, for the purpose of procuring food. In the southern cities of
the United States, the Black Vulture congregates in large numbers; its relative
of South America (<i>Cathartes Brasiliensis</i>) possesses the same habit, and
is exceedingly abundant in the cities of the countries that it inhabits. Even
the gigantic Condor does not hesitate to make its appearance in the vicinity
of villages or dwellings in the western countries of South America for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
same purpose. In this respect these birds resemble the most common European
bird of their family which inhabits southern Europe, and also Asia and
northern Africa; the <i>Neophron percnopterus</i> or Egyptian Vulture. The
latter is, however, very different in colour, being nearly white when adult, and
<i>clean</i>, which is an important consideration in a bird of habitually filthy habits.</p>
<p>Travellers have represented the male of the Condor as larger and as having
more handsome plumage than the female. We hope to be excused for here
asking attention to this point, should opportunity occur to any of our readers.
It is the only known or supposed instance in the order of Rapacious Birds, of
the male being the larger, and, if true, of course establishes an exception hitherto
not recognized by naturalists. In these birds, and especially in the Falcons
and Eagles, the difference in the size of the sexes of the same species is
often very remarkable, but the larger is invariably the female.</p>
<p>Further experiments and observations by persons having suitable opportunities
and facilities are very desirable for the purpose of ascertaining the
degree of development of the senses of sight and smell in the Vultures. Eminent
authors have maintained quite opposite views on this subject, some attributing
the fact that they perceive objects suitable for their food from a distance,
to the acuteness of their sight and others to their power of smelling.
This is yet an open question, though there is a very considerable amount of
evidence on each side, and may be regarded as presenting an interesting field
for further investigation.</p>

<p>Having in the eastern portion of the United States no traditions nor architectural
remains which date beyond the first settlement of the white man, our
people are but little prone to many of the superstitions which have prevailed
in the old world. In the absence of the ruined monastery or crumbling
abbey, of the ivy-covered baronial castle and haunted tower, local and
legendary superstitions especially, have found no considerable nor permanent
place in the popular mind.</p>
<p>Some reliance in the influence of the moon, and a small degree of attention
to the aspect of the sign of the zodiac according to the time-honored
frontispiece in the almanac, both materially lacking in the important requisite
of full and trusting faith, are very nearly the only mysteries which can be
regarded as having acquired a practical adoption in any appreciable degree.
Others, as the witchcraft of former and the Spiritualism of latter times, as
in other countries, have temporarily assumed aspects of more or less importance,
but have either disappeared, or, awaiting the certain test of Christian
enlightenment and unprejudiced examination, have taken the form of religious
faith, and are held in conscientious veneration. An occasional exception
may be found, too, in the local transplanting of an European, or perhaps of
an African tradition, but many superstitions of the old world are almost
absolutely unknown; the evil Banshee, the gentler Brownie, Puck and
Oberon, Mab and Titania have no local habitation, though well beloved as
beautiful accessories in the immortal productions of the poets, or as told by
an humble mother to her children in tales of remembrance of her native
land.</p>
<p>In the higher order of legends&mdash;in those which record facts or dim
histories of exceeding antiquity, or in which are embalmed the deeds of the
remote hero, though even more faded than his features on the mouldering
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
wall or the faded marble&mdash;young America pleads her youth. But not
without product&mdash;and as that which has been shall be again, as legends and
traditions like to those of other nations will very probably be amongst the
results of American mind, there is one American name, perhaps as yet one
only, which may become mythical or even now is. When thousands of years
shall have rolled away, and the annals of the present age shall be known
only to the scholar and the antiquary of those times in precious scraps and
fragments, the adjusting of which shall require the skilfulness of learning,
some future Lepsius or Layard may recognise in a wise Minos or in a just
Nemesis, the American Washington.</p>
<p>The Republic of the United States has acquired its position as a nation,
and in fact has existed only in an age of enlightenment, and the universal
attention to education and the diffusion of general knowledge which happily
has ever prevailed in a degree not exceeded in any country, has necessarily
prevented in a great measure the forming of orally transmitted histories or
of legendary fables, and there being no ruins of buildings nor other evidences
of the decay of past ages, our people do not associate with ideas of desolation,
animals which might have found suitable habitations in such localities, nor
have they attributed traditional associations or characters.</p>
<p>We have no birds of ill omen, and even the long-defamed Owl has escaped
his usual reputation; not that he is regarded with favor, rather the reverse;
but for other reason than attributed connexion with supernatural agents; nor
is his appearance in the neighborhood of the farm-house or the settler&rsquo;s
cabin regarded as at all ominous, except of immediate danger to whatever of
the domestic poultry may have attracted his attention, or in any degree foreboding,
unless of his own abrupt demise in case he happens to be observed
by the proprietor, having at hand his trusty rifle or fowling-piece. The owl
takes the greater risk in such an adventure.</p>
<p>On account, in some measure, of their peculiar forms, particularly their
large heads and staring eyes, their nocturnal habits, and their habitually
resorting in the day-time to secluded haunts in the forest or other little-frequented
localities, no animals have been more invariably regarded as of
evil portent than owls. And in this character they have found a place in
the literature, and especially the poetry, of nearly all nations ancient and
modern. The Latin writers seldom fail to mention the appearance of the
owl among the omens and prodigies which they frequently enumerate as
having preceded disasters to the state or to distinguished personages. Pliny
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
in his Natural History, gravely devotes a chapter to Inauspicious Birds, and
gives the owl a post of distinction in this manner: &ldquo;The owl, a dismal bird,
and very much dreaded in public auguries, inhabits deserts which are not
only desolate, but dreary and inaccessible: it is a monster of night, nor does
it possess any voice but a groan. Thus, when it is seen in towns or in daylight,
it is an omen to be dreaded.&rdquo; Book x., chapter 12. The poets give him
the same reputation, but perhaps only in the legitimate exercise of their art.
The poet is privileged in the entire domain of nature, and Virgil and
Shakspeare have forever commemorated, though somewhat infamously, the
Owl. The former alludes to it as one of numerous precursors of the death
of Dido:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Solaque culminibus ferali carmine bubo</p>
<p class="t0">S&aelig;pe queri, et longas in fletum ducere voces.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Whilst lonely on the roof, night&rsquo;s bird prolongs</p>
<p class="t0">The notes of woe, and shrieks funereal songs.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Shakspeare uses the Owl in the same capacity of direful portent. Thus
Casca, in allusion to omens preceding the death of C&aelig;sar:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And yesterday, the bird of night did sit</p>
<p class="t0">Even at noon-day upon the market-place</p>
<p class="t0">Hooting and shrieking:&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>and in Macbeth he introduces its cry as an accompaniment of the murder
of Duncan:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Hark! Peace! It was the owl that shrieked,</p>
<p class="t0">The fatal bellman, which giv&rsquo;st the stern&rsquo;st good-night.</p>
<p class="t0">He is about it:&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>and again in Henry the Sixth:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The owl shriek&rsquo;d at thy birth; an evil sign;</p>
<p class="t0">The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time,</p>
<p class="t0">Dogs howl&rsquo;d, and hideous tempests shook down trees.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Shakspeare has various other passages of much the same tenor, and so have
many other poets of the English and other languages; but, as we can say truly
with Cowper (in Task):</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The jay, the pie, and e&rsquo;en the boding owl,</p>
<p class="t0">That hails the rising moon, have charms for <i>us</i>,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>we have no intention at all of making out a strong case of bad reputation
against him, even from the poets. We ought to say, though, that he has
borne this reputation much more recently than the time of Pliny, and in
some countries of the old world has scarcely yet attained a character of entire
respectability. There might be a difficulty, however, in deciding which is
the more remarkable, the things said of him, or the gravity of the sayer. A
writer, cited in Brand&rsquo;s Popular Antiquities, says to the point: &ldquo;In the year
1542, at Herbipolis or Wirtzburg, in Franconia, this unlucky bird by his
screeching songs affrighted the citizens a long time together, and immediately
followed a great plague, war, and other calamities. About twenty years ago,
I did observe that in the house where I lodged, an Owl groaning in the window
presaged the death of two eminent persons who died there shortly after.&rdquo;
Another, bringing the matter to a more general bearing, says: &ldquo;If an owl,
which is reckoned a most abominable and unlucky bird, send forth its hoarse
and dismal voice, it is an omen of the approach of something: that some dire
calamity and some great misfortune is near at hand.&rdquo; And amongst many
similar stories, it is related by an old author, that when a Duke of Cleves
was suffering with the disease of which he afterwards died, an Owl was seen
and heard frequently upon the palace of Cleves in the day-time, and could
scarcely be driven away. Very wonderful, but not calculated for the present
meridian, and happily rather out of date generally. It would scarcely suit
the citizens of our frontier States to regard in any such aspect the nightly
serenades of the Great Horned Owl, though performed in a style entirely
appropriate.</p>
<p>Other nations, and some more ancient than the Romans, also regarded the
Owl with various degrees of superstition. In Egypt, at one period, an image
of an Owl transmitted by the supreme authority to a subject, was an intimation
in established form, that the latter would particularly oblige his sovereign
by immediately committing suicide. With which civil invitation, compliance,
at earliest convenience, appears to have been necessary, not entirely as a
matter of mere politeness, but to save himself from aspersions as a man of
honor and a gentleman. An instance is related by Diodorus Siculus, in
which a person placed in such a dilemma and manifesting some repugnance
and uncourtly backwardness, was put to death by one of his parents to save
their house from disgrace.</p>
<p>But the people of the present day have been favored to live in an age
characterized in all Christian countries by the diffusion of truth and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
progress of intellectual cultivation, and in which, as a peculiar feature, the
physical sciences especially have tended to dispel the mists of ages. In
accordance with the spirit of it, modern writers rarely resort to the adoption,
even in poetic composition, of ungrounded popular errors. Thus, with no
such implication, Coleridge, in Christabel, introduces the Owl in an opening
chorus:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the middle of the night by the castle-clock,</p>

<p class="t0">And hark again! the crowing cock</p>
<p class="t0">How drowsily he crew.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And beautiful too is the allusion to the Owl by Longfellow, in Hyperion:
&ldquo;For the owl is a grave bird; a monk who chants midnight mass in the great
temple of Nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirtland&rsquo;s Owl, which we present to our readers in the plate now before
us, is one of the most recent additions to the Ornithological Fauna of this
country, and was first brought to notice by Philo R. Hoy, M. D., an eminent
naturalist and physician of Racine, Wisconsin, who has ascertained its occurrence,
and has succeeded in obtaining several specimens in the neighborhood
of that city.</p>
<p>It appears, however, to be by no means a common species, though having
been observed in the season of incubation, as well as in the winter, it may be
presumed to be a constant resident, and further investigation may bring to
light full details of its history. It belongs to a group composed of several
species of small owls, found in the northern regions of both continents, the
most common of which, in this country, is the little Acadian Owl (<i>Nyctale
acadica</i>), a curious and rather handsome little species not very well known
in the rural districts, but sometimes occurring, and also occasionally captured,
in the cities. It is the least of the owls of the Atlantic States. Another
species is known as Tengmalm&rsquo;s Owl (<i>N. Tengmalmii</i>), which inhabits the
higher northern latitudes of America and Europe.</p>
<p>Like the other small species of its family, the present Owl probably subsists
on the smaller birds and quadrupeds and on insects. The last form no
inconsiderable portion of the food of the smaller Owls. We have repeatedly
found the remains of insects in the stomachs of several species; and in 1851,
during the period of the appearance of the Seventeen-year Locust (<i>Cicada
septemdecim</i>) in the neighborhood of Philadelphia, we enjoyed an opportunity,
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
in company with several members of the Academy of Natural Sciences
of this city, of observing the common Red Owl (<i>Ephialtes asio</i>) while engaged
in feeding on insects of that remarkable species. It captured them principally
in an apple-tree in which it was first noticed, but occasionally pursued its
object to the ground, and with a degree of adroitness and avidity which fully
evinced that it had been accustomed to similar occupation.</p>
<p>Dr. Hoy&rsquo;s description of the species now before us was first published in
the Proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy, VI. p. 211, (Dec. 1852,) from
which we make the following extract:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But two specimens of this bird have been taken, to my knowledge; the
first was captured in October 1851, and kept until winter, when it made its
escape; the second, that from which the above description was taken, flew
into an open shop, July 1852. It is strictly nocturnal, utters a low tremulous
note, and is an active and efficient mouser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have been informed by Dr. Hoy that during the past summer (1853,)
he had succeeded in obtaining another specimen which proved to be a female.
It is slightly larger than the male, but similar in all other respects.</p>
<p>The figures in our plate represent the male bird, and are about two-thirds
of the size of life.</p>

<br />Blanding&rsquo;s Finch.
<br />PLATE XII.&mdash;Adult Male.</h2>
<p>Blanding&rsquo;s Finch was discovered in the Rocky mountains by Dr. Gambel,
and named by him in honor of one of the most universally respected of
American naturalists and friends of science, William Blanding, M. D.,
formerly a resident of Philadelphia, but now of Providence, Rhode Island.
During many years of previous residence in South Carolina, Dr. Blanding
omitted no opportunity of facilitating by observation and active exertion in
contributing to collections, the advancement of the interests of Natural
Science in all its departments, and he has been deservedly complimented by
naturalists whose studies he has been the means of promoting, and with
whom personally he has for many years maintained relations of the most
friendly character. Many of the cultivators of Natural History in America
owe much to the advice and encouragement of Dr. Blanding, and among
such we gratefully include ourselves.</p>
<p>This bird belongs to a group of which several species are known to inhabit
Mexico and South America, and of which one other species is a summer
visitor to Texas. All of them are birds of handsome and even elegant
general appearance and color of plumage, and partake much of the inoffensive
habits of other birds of the family to which they belong, and which includes
the Finches and Sparrows. Subsisting for the greater part on seeds, much
of their time is passed on the ground, or in undergrowths of shrubbery in
the immediate vicinity of fields and meadows, or other grass-bearing
localities.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>We regard the present species as the handsomest Bird of the family of
Sparrows yet discovered in the United States, and regret that it is not in
our power to lay before our readers an account of it at all full or satisfactory,
little having been placed on record, or having otherwise come to our
knowledge, beyond the fact that it inhabits sparingly the Rocky mountains,
California and northern Texas. It is probably one of the many species
which migrate in summer to those countries from Mexico, and even further
southward, as is the case with the greater part of the numerous species of
birds which are summer-residents in the eastern portion of this continent.
Not more than three specimens of this bird have been brought home in the
many extensive collections made by the various naturalists who have visited
the countries where it is found, from which we must necessarily infer at
present that it is one of the rarest of the birds of California and the Rocky
mountains, though more abundant in Texas.</p>
<p>From Dr. Gambel&rsquo;s paper containing his description of this bird, published
in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia,
I. p. 260, (April 1843,) and subsequently in the Journal of the same society,
I. p. 51 (Quarto), we extract the following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of this new and singularly marked species, I procured a single specimen
only, in September, on the bank of a small stream in the Rocky mountains,
about half-way between New Mexico and the Colorado of the West. It kept
in low bushes, in company with <i>Fringilla guttata</i>, and <i>F. graminea</i>, occasionally
uttering a single chirp. The throat and breast of this species very
much resemble those of <i>Fringilla Pennsylvanica</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Woodhouse procured, also, one specimen, only, during Capt. Sitgreaves&rsquo;
Expedition to the Zu&ntilde;i, and Colorado rivers, respecting which he observes:
&ldquo;Whilst encamped on the Rio Salado, near San Antonio, Texas, in the
beginning of April, I procured a solitary specimen of this beautiful and
interesting bird. Its favorite haunts seemed to be the low bushes in the
vicinity of the creek; this was the only one that I observed east of the Rio
Grande. In the Zuni mountain, and in the vicinity of the <i>pueblo</i> of Zu&ntilde;i,
it was quite abundant.&rdquo; (Report of an Expedition down the Zu&ntilde;i and
Colorado rivers, by Capt. L. Sitgreaves, of the Topographical Engineer
Corps, U. S. Army, Washington, 1853. Zoology, p. 85.)</p>
<p>It was also seen by Dr. Heermann, in California.</p>
<p>Our figure is that of a male, and is about two-thirds of the natural size.</p>

respects, but not with sufficient precision to be determined. He represents it
as &ldquo;a true <i>Fringilla</i>. The head of light brownish color spotted with dusky,
back varied with dusky and greenish olive, rump brownish spotted with
dusky, &amp;c.&rdquo; Our present bird is by no means a true Fringilla, nor does
the description otherwise apply to it with such degree of probability as to be
relied on.</p>

<br />The American House-Finch.
<br />PLATE XIII.&mdash;Male and Female.</h2>
<p>When the winter of our northern climes has abated its rigors, and the
season of brighter skies and returning flowers approaches, none of its early
tokens are welcomed with more pleasing associations, than the reappearance
of those familiar birds, which, like the Wren, the Blue Bird, and the Pewee
Flycatcher, come pleasantly into the immediate vicinity of our dwellings, to
select accommodations for the construction of their nests, and for rearing
their young. They share the hospitality of the splendid mansion and the
humble cottage, and are made welcome alike in each.</p>
<p>Of birds of this description, no species is more remarkable for its confiding
disposition, than the little Finch now before the reader, and which is a native
of the western countries of North America. It not only approaches the
abodes of men without hesitation, and occupies habitually the suitable parts
of houses and other buildings, but resorts in large numbers to such uncongenial
localities as one might think them, as towns and cities. In several
of those in New Mexico, and California, this bird is very abundant, and is a
great favorite.</p>
<p>Several species of the same genus to which the present belongs, all of
which present considerable similarity, inhabit northern countries of this
continent, and others are found in the same latitudes of the old world.
The males of all the species are clothed in plumage of fine crimson, or of
purple of various and delicate shades, when they have attained maturity.
The females are however of much plainer appearance, and generally present
little similarity of color to their more gay consorts. The Purple Finch
(<i>Carpodacus purpureus</i>) is the best-known American bird of this group. It
is common as a winter visitor in the middle and southern States, and at
that season its habits are such only as are adapted to a roving life in the
woods. It retires in the spring to the northern states, and the mountains of
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
Pennsylvania, and is there regarded with much favor on account of the
beauty of its plumage and its agreeable song.</p>
<p>A species of the old world (<i>C. erythrinus</i>), which is one of several that
are natives of northern Russia, of Siberia and Kamtschatka, is very similar
in its general appearance to the Purple Finch, and, like it too, it has an
extensive range of migration, appearing throughout European and Asiatic
Russia, and the northern countries of India. Of the Asiatic species, one
is remarkable for having been discovered on Mount Sinai, by an European
naturalist, and in reference to that fact, has been named by him the Sinai
Finch (<i>Carpodacus sinaiticus</i>.)</p>
<p>Our present bird appears to be the species alluded to by Dr. Gambel as
the crimson-fronted Finch, <i>Erythrospiza frontalis</i> (Say), in the Journal of
the Philadelphia Academy, Quarto, I. p. 53, in the following passage: &ldquo;This
handsome songster we first observed in New Mexico, particularly about
Sante F&eacute;, where it is an abundant and familiar resident, keeping about the
<i>corrals</i> and gardens, and building its nest under the portals and sheds of the
houses. In July the young were ready to fly, which must have been a
second brood, or else they begin to lay much later than in California.
Under a long shed or <i>portal</i>, in the Plaza or Square of Sante F&eacute;, they had
a great many nests; and the old birds would sometimes fly down about our
feet while sitting at the doors, to pick up crumbs, &amp;c. for their young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In California, it is also an extremely abundant and familiar resident, and
is called by the inhabitants <i>Buriones</i>. During winter they assemble in
flocks, frequenting the bushy plains and hill-sides, hedges, vineyards and
gardens, living on the various kinds of seeds which are so abundant, and also
sometimes doing considerable damage among the grapes. Early in March
they commence pairing, and soon are busy building their nests; placing
entire confidence in man (which is but too often misplaced) they persist in
building about the houses; on the projecting planks under the portals, under
the eaves, in sheds, boxes or in any nook they can find. I once found a
nest in a small box of seeds which had been stuck up over a door. They
will also build on the horizontal branch of a tree in the garden, and a great
many nests are made in the willow hedges of the vineyards, but they prefer
by far the rafters under the sheds and houses, repaying the inmates for
the privilege, with their most melodious song, which is continued during
summer, from the roof near the nest. The nest is made of small sticks, or
stems of weeds, willow catkins and down of the willow, and lined with horse-hair.
They usually lay five eggs, sometimes of a plain bluish white color
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
only, but generally having a few scattering streaks and specks of dark brown
on the larger end. Some nests are made principally of feathers, cotton or
wool, with a few sticks and dried grass, and lined with horse-hair. Frequently
only four eggs are found in the nest, and they often have a very few
specks or streaks on one side only.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be impossible, with words, to describe the song of this western
Orpheus; and although California contains many song-birds, among others
the Mocking-Bird, yet there is none more exhilarating to the feelings, or
melodious and tender to the ear, than the song of this Finch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This bird was first described satisfactorily as a distinct species, by Col.
M&lsquo;Call, in the Proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy, VI. p. 61, (April
1852.) In a previous paper in the same periodical, V. p. 219 (June 1851)
he thus alludes to it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found this charming little Finch abundant at Sante F&eacute;, where it commenced
nesting in March, although the weather was still wintry, and so
continued, with frequent snow-storms, for more than a month. Notwithstanding
this, the song of the male failed not to cheer his mate during
incubation, with the liveliest melody. The notes often reminded me of
the soft trill of the house-wren, and as often of the clear warble of the
canary. The males of the last year, though mated and apparently equally
happy and quite as assiduous as their seniors, were not yet in full plumage,
having little or nothing of the red colors that mark the adult birds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nests, which were stuck into every cranny about the eaves and
porticoes of the houses throughout the town, were variously composed of dry
grass, fine roots, horse-hair, long pieces of cotton twine, or strips of old
calico; in fine, of countless odds and ends, that were picked up about the
yards;&mdash;these were curiously and firmly interwoven, so as to make a warm
and comfortable abode for the new-comers. Eggs, four or five, pale blue,
slightly marked on the larger end. The young were able to fly by the
middle or latter part of April. A second brood, and in some cases, I believe
a third was raised during the summer, as not a few of them continue to
incubate until some time in the month of August. Before the latter part of
September, however, nearly all of them had disappeared from about Santa
F&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the following additional account of this species, prepared expressly for
the present article, we are also indebted to Col. M&lsquo;Call:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whilst residing in New Mexico, I always remarked a gentle amity in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
character of this lively little songster which failed not to bespeak for him the
kindly regard of all with whom he made his abode, whether the wealthy
proprietor of the manor-house, or the humble <i>peon</i>, whose miserable hut
stood aloof from the mansion. For, the same cheerful melody that soothed
the noontide of the former while idly swinging in his hammock, welcomed
the appearance of the latter as he came forth at the dawn of day to resume
his toil; the same confiding familiarity was observable in his approach to
both, and the same merry pranks were played, whether feeding on the
bounty of the one, or gleaning a more scanty meal near the ill-furnished
table of the other. It was this pleasing trait in his character which
prompted me in the choice of his name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His disposition also towards other birds, appeared to be mild and peaceful,
as I had many opportunities to observe. I will mention one instance: In
the piazza of the house I occupied, quite a colony of these birds had their
nests: here the work of building and incubation had gone on prosperously
for several weeks, although the weather at times was stormy and cold, and
ere the genial warmth of spring was fairly felt, the colony might have been
said to be fully established. As the season advanced and birds of less hardy
nature began to arrive from the south, a pair of Barn-Swallows (<i>H. rufa</i>)
made their appearance, and forthwith entered the territory of the Finches.
And here they at once, very unceremoniously, began to erect their domicil.
This act of aggression would have been fiercely resented by most birds, and
violent measures would have been promptly resorted to, to eject the intruders.
The conduct of the little finches was quite different: at first they stood aloof
and seemed to regard the strangers with suspicion and distrust, rather than
enmity. In the mean time the swallows went quietly to work, without
showing any inclination to intermeddle; and in a day or two [their mud-walls
all the time rapidly advancing] they gained the confidence of their neighbors,
and finally completed their work unmolested. Indeed, a perfect harmony was
established between the parties, which I never saw interrupted by a single
quarrel during the time they remained my tenants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This incident, and I would mention others were it necessary, illustrates
the character of this species in strong contrast with that of its relative, the
Purple-Finch, (<i>C. purpureus</i>,) which both Wilson and Audubon agree in
representing, from personal observation, as quarrelsome, tyrannical and
domineering in the extreme. This species may, moreover, be considered as
a more southern bird than the Purple-Finch, its northern range probably not
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
extending much beyond the limits of New Mexico, on the eastern slope
of the Rocky mountains; while that of the other stretches to the Fur
countries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the western slope, it is common throughout California, but not in
Oregon. At the Missions of San Diego and San Gabriel it nested in the hedge-rows,
as well as in the buildings. I often saw it in numbers on the edges of
the immense fields of wild mustard, a plant which, introduced by the early
Spanish missionaries, now overruns whole districts of that country, and in
size and vigor of growth is almost arborescent; but whether it nested in
these thickets or not, I did not ascertain. Yet I found the nests of the
Red-winged Black-bird (<i>A. ph&oelig;niceus</i>) in numbers, placed at the distance of
6 or 8 feet from the ground, in the branches of the wild mustard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The food of this species, like its congeners, consists at different seasons of
buds, fruits, the seeds of various grasses and wild plants, which it often
plucks from the capsules while hanging inverted or sidewise on the
bending stalk. Insects are also eaten, I believe, at all seasons. But in
its half-domesticated condition at Santa F&eacute;, nothing edible seemed to be
amiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This species appears to congregate into flocks at the close of the summer
season, and to adopt the wandering habits of its near relative the Purple-Finch
previously alluded to in this article. They migrate at that period and
during the winter to Mexico, and probably to the countries of Central
America. The following notice is from Dr. Heermann&rsquo;s Notes on the Birds
of California, (Jour. Philada. Acad. Quarto, II. p. 267,) and relates to this
bird:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very abundant and found in large flocks in the fall season, feeding on
the buds of young trees. I found this species abundant at Guaymas, where
it breeds under the eaves of houses, in the branches of the small cactus
plants; and one nest I discovered in a deserted woodpecker&rsquo;s hole, made in
the body of an upright cactus, one and a half feet in diameter and about
fifteen feet high, with which species of plants the country near Guaymas is
covered. In California I found its nest on the dwarf oaks, composed of
coarse grasses and lined with fine hair. The eggs, from four to six in
number, are pale blue, marked with spots and delicate lines of black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Woodhouse also notices this bird as abundant in New Mexico and
California, (Sitgreaves&rsquo; Report, Zoology, p. 88.)</p>

William Jardine in his edition of Wilson&rsquo;s American Ornithology, I. p. 121,
(London and Edinburgh, 1832, 3 vols. octavo). The <i>Fringilla h&aelig;morrhoa</i>,

<br />The Long-tailed Chickadee.
<br />PLATE XIV.&mdash;Male Adult.</h2>
<p>The form and general appearance of this little bird resemble those of its
congeners, the Black-capped Chickadee (<i>P. atricapillus</i>) and the Carolina
Chickadee (<i>P. carolinensis</i>). It is, however, larger than either of those
species, and presents other characters which not only fully demonstrate it
to be entitled to specific distinction, but, very probably, to possess features
in its history different in some respects from any of its relatives.</p>
<p>Its bill is longer and more strongly developed, indicating perhaps a
different race of insects as its food. Its tail is unusually long, and its entire
organization stronger and larger than either of the species above mentioned,
with the larger of which (<i>P. atricapillus</i>), it has erroneously been considered
identical by some European authors.</p>
<p>This little bird is strictly a western species, and for its discovery and the
first description of it, we are indebted to Edward Harris, Esq., of New
Jersey, well known as one of the most eminent cultivators of Zoological
science in America. It was discovered by Mr. Harris during a visit to the
Upper Missouri and Yellow Stone rivers, in company with the late Mr.
Audubon, and which was the last journey ever performed by the latter
distinguished gentleman. The description, with some valuable observations
on other species of the genus <i>Parus</i>, was first published in the Proceedings
of the Philadelphia Academy, Vol. II. p. 300, (Dec. 1845,) from which we
make the following extract:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A single specimen of this bird was procured on the 26th of July on the
Yellow Stone river, about thirty miles above its junction with the Missouri.
It is evidently a bird of the season, with immature plumage, to which may
be attributed the dullness of the black on the head and throat. On comparison
of this bird with <i>P. carolinensis</i> and <i>P. atricapillus</i>, it will be
perceived that, beginning with the smallest bird, the parts which are black,
decrease, and the white parts increase in size and intensity, in ascending.
In <i>septentrionalis</i> the outer web of the lateral tail-feather is entirely white,
except a small portion at the base, where there is a slight tinge of grey next
the shaft; and the quills, secondaries and all the tail-feathers are margined
more broadly and with a purer white than in the other species.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The note of this bird is similar to that of <i>P. atricapillus</i>, but its voice more
liquid and less harsh and querulous in the utterance. Bill longer and stouter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This bird has been received at the Philadelphia Academy in a collection
made by Mr. Edward M. Kern, while attached as Artist to the exploring
party commanded by Col. Fr&eacute;mont in 1846. A very fine specimen is in the
collection made by the surveying party under the command of Capt. Stansbury
in the vicinity of the Great Salt Lake of Utah, and is noticed in Prof.
Baird&rsquo;s Zoological appendix to Capt. Stansbury&rsquo;s Report, p. 316. (June 1852.)</p>

<br />The Red-breasted Teal.
<br />PLATE XV.&mdash;Male and Female.</h2>
<p>This handsomely colored and elegant little Teal, is of frequent occurrence
in Western America, though first noticed as a North American species in
Louisiana, by E. Pilat&eacute;, M. D., a physician and naturalist, residing at
Opelousas in that State. In a communication to us accompanying one of
the first specimens obtained by him and intended for the collection of the
Philadelphia Academy, that gentleman mentions having occasionally seen it
in company with other species of ducks, but regards its appearance as
unusual in Louisiana. The specimen alluded to, which is that of a male
in very fine spring plumage, is now in the collection of the society
mentioned. According to Dr. Pilat&eacute;, who has paid much attention to
Natural History, this bird associates with other small species of water-birds,
and appears to possess, in the migrating season, similar habits, and frequents
the same places of resort, though rather unusually shy and vigilant.</p>
<p>Our valued friends Capt. Howard Stansbury, of the U. S. Topographical
Engineers, in his able Report of a Survey of the valley of the Great Salt
Lake of Utah, and Prof. Spencer F. Baird, of the Smithsonian Institution,
in a valuable Zoological appendix to that Report, allude to this Duck as
commonly met with in Utah, and especially in the vicinity of the Great Salt
Lake. It was observed frequenting the rivers and small streams. The
collection brought home by Capt. Stansbury containing many objects of the
highest interest and scientific value, which are described with his usual great
accuracy in Prof. Baird&rsquo;s Appendix, is now in the National Museum at
Washington city. The specimens of the present bird were obtained in the
river Jordan, a stream emptying into the Lake, and so named by the settlers
in that region, who are principally of the religious denomination of
Mormons.</p>

though not unfrequent in the northern regions of this continent.</p>
<p>Mr. Hancock, whose opportunities were ample, fully demonstrates (as cited
above) that the <i>Falco gr&oelig;nlandicus</i> of Greenland, which is the present
species, and the <i>Falco islandicus</i> of Iceland, are distinct, which appears to be
assented to by all late writers. The bird, figured by Mr. Audubon as the
adult of the species of which the young bird was obtained by him in
Labrador, was an Iceland specimen, (Orn. Biog. IV. p. 476,) and therefore
not correctly given as the American bird. We have never had the satisfaction
of seeing the adult of this species; but for an opportunity of examining one
of Mr. Audubon&rsquo;s Labrador specimens, we are indebted to the Rev. John
Bachman, D. D., of Charleston, S. C., who, with that disposition to advance
the interests of Zoological Science which has always characterized him, most
kindly forwarded it at our request.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Obs.</span> The adult of this species is with difficulty distinguishable from the
European <i>H. &aelig;salon</i>, but we have never seen the latter in the nearly black
plumage, which we regard as characterizing the young or winter plumage,
of the American bird. The light, &ldquo;liver brown&rdquo; plumage, represented by
European authors as the female of <i>F. &aelig;salon</i>, frequently occurs in this bird,
and is given by Rich. and Swains. in Fauna Boreali Americana, Birds, pl.
25. The adult which appears to be <i>Falco temerarius</i>, Aud., is figured in B.
of Am. pl. 75, the other figures by Aud. pl. 92, and Wilson&rsquo;s plate, represent
this bird in the dark plumage as described above.</p>
<p>Adult specimens from Western America, even more closely resemble the
European species, but differ from the Eastern American only in small and
scarcely describable particulars, as the slightly greater extent of the white
front, or the greater purity of the white of the throat and breast. We
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
regard the stage of plumage above described as that of the female, (and
as figured by Rich. and Swains.) principally on account of its analogy to
the female of the nearly allied European species.</p>
<p>This bird is of frequent occurrence in the United States. The largest
specimens that we have ever seen are from Oregon, and may prove to be of
a distinct species, though we cannot at present, determine.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Obs.</span> This little Hawk is one of the most common of the North American
species. It is very similar, when adult, to the <i>Accipiter nisus</i> of Europe,
but the young differ, as is the case with nearly all our Hawks which resemble
birds of the old world. We have never seen a specimen of <i>A. fuscus</i> with
the transverse bands on the under parts regular and unbroken, as is commonly
met with in the young female of <i>A. nisus</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Though we regard the law of priority as of great importance, we have in
the case of this species continued Gmelin&rsquo;s specific name <i>fuscus</i>, (1788,)
though it had been previously used by Fabricius, (1780; see <i>Hierofalco sacer</i>
in this synopsis.) We know of no practical benefit, however, that would
now result from the alteration of this long established name, especially as
the <i>fuscus</i> of Fabricius is a synonyme itself. Any naturalist, however,
being so moved, may call this bird <i>Accipiter dubius</i>, if he chooses, and shall
not be molested by us.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Obs.</span> This handsome little species is of rather unusual occurrence in the
middle and southern States, though according to Dr. Hoy it is abundant in
Wisconsin. It is an easily recognized species, though presenting considerable
variations in color, according to age and season.</p>
<p>The names <i>Falco pennsylvanicus</i> and <i>Falco latissimus</i> occur in different
copies of the sixth volume of the original edition of Wilson (1812), and the
probability is that the latter was substituted by the author, in the later printed
copies, after he had noticed that he had previously applied the name <i>pennsylvanicus</i>
to another species. Of the last three volumes only second editions
were published under the editorship of Mr. Ord; the seventh and eighth in
1824, and the ninth in 1825. The statement in Hall&rsquo;s edition, I. p. 92 (Philadelphia,
1828), that the name <i>latissimus</i> was given by Mr. Ord, is therefore
incorrect. That gentleman, now President of the Philadelphia Academy, and
of whose advice and instruction we have the great advantage and gratification,
informs us that he had nothing to do with either of the names to which we
here allude.</p>

species immediately preceding. Such may be the truth of the case, and our
only reason for giving it thus is, that after careful comparison and examination
of numerous specimens, we find it absolutely impossible to distinguish it,
by any character whatever, from the European bird. Whether two birds can
be exactly the same in all their characters, so far as presented by specimens,
and yet be distinct in species, is a question that we are not prepared at present
practically to decide. We regard it as quite possible, however, that the
present may be the young of <i>A. sancti-johannis</i>. It is one of the most common
species of its family. Mr. Bell&rsquo;s specimens from California are, so far
as we can see, exactly the same as the European bird, differing from eastern

and longer tarsi. The adults are, however, entirely dissimilar.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Obs.</span> The Caracara Eagle has been observed in Florida, and is an inhabitant
also of Texas and Mexico. It walks on the ground with facility, and
otherwise resembles the Vultures in its habits; and, like them, lives on dead
animals for the greater part. The original edition of Molina, in which a
scientific name is given to this bird for the first time since the adoption of the
binomial nomenclature, we have not seen; but in his second edition, Preface,
p. 1 (Bologna, 1810), it is stated to have been published in 1782. His name
undoubtedly has priority.</p>
<p>We are inclined to the opinion that this bird, and several more or less
nearly allied species of South America, belong properly to the family of
Vultures;&mdash;of all the habits of which they partake. This opinion is supported
somewhat by Molina&rsquo;s statement, that of the present species the
female is the smaller (2d ed., p. 221), as Humboldt and others have observed
of the Condor, and as appears to be the case in the family of Vultures, but
not in that of the Falcons.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">Obs.</span> Col. McCall, who has seen this bird in large numbers in Texas,
represents it as habitually frequenting the ground in the vicinity of water,
and especially abundant on both sides of the Rio Grande. It is slow and
heavy in flight, and a dull, sluggish bird in all its habits, partaking in these
respects of the general characters of the Vultures.</p>
<p>The affinities of this species we regard at present as uncertain, and arrange
it provisionally only in the present genus and sub-family, but by no means
agreeing in our views with late European ornithologists.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>The foregoing are all the birds of this family which can be regarded as
well-established species inhabiting that portion of North America, within our
prescribed limits.</p>
<p>Respecting their history, one of the most important questions to the
naturalist is, the change of plumage from young to mature age, and another
change which takes place in assuming their spring or summer and their winter
liveries. The latter change is by no means well understood in many species,
and to ascertain it completely in any one would yet be an interesting contribution
to its history.</p>
<p>A few species are known only as of exceedingly rare occurrence in the
United States, but the larger number are sufficiently numerous to be investigated
without difficulty. Of the former, the Washington Eagle (<i>Haliaetus
Washingtonii</i>), Harlan&rsquo;s Buzzard (<i>Buteo Harlani</i>), the Black Hawk, the
Rough-legged Hawk (<i>Archibuteo sancti-johannis</i> and <i>lagopus</i>,) and nearly
all the Western species, may be regarded as particularly requiring further
research.</p>
<p>In the winter season, various species resort to the sea-coast, and others to
the margins of bays and rivers in considerable numbers. In the vicinity
of the cities these have, however, greatly diminished since the introduction
of steamboats and railroads. Steam-engines, and especially locomotives, are
innovations for which the Eagles and Hawks evidently have no fancy. To
the markets appropriated to the accommodation of farmers and traders from
the rural districts in all the cities on the Atlantic seaboard, specimens are
frequently brought for sale, a demand, reliable to some extent, having arisen
from collectors and amateurs.</p>
<p>Occasionally an immense multitude of Hawks soaring high in the air, and
in company, has been observed. This curious phenomenon has been seen by
our friends, Professor Baird, of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington
city; Dr. Hoy, of Racine, Wisconsin; and by ourselves. It occurs in autumn,
and is probably incidental to migration; but its exact character and object is
unknown, and involves an interesting inquiry. It is necessarily temporary,
as the procuring of suitable food by such a large number of rapacious birds
would be impossible.</p>
<p>In the western and northern regions of North America, the birds of this
family are particularly worthy of the attention of the traveller and naturalist,
and would undoubtedly well repay him in the discovery of unknown
species. This is the case also in the States of Florida and Texas, to the
latter of which, very probably, some of the many Mexican species are visitors,
that have not yet been noticed.</p>
<p>In Oregon and Russian-America, there are also very probably species
which have not been recognized as inhabitants of this continent, though well
known as birds of Northern Asia, and others entirely unknown to naturalists.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Of this bird, Gmelin gives a short abstract of Pennant&rsquo;s description, and
applies a scientific name. Naturalists relying solely on that abstract, have
erroneously considered the species meant as the Golden Eagle (<i>A. chrysaetus</i>),
and the name <i>Falco americanus</i> has accordingly been usually quoted as a
synonyme. Though &ldquo;feathered below the knees&rdquo; is somewhat indefinite,
yet, taken in connexion with &ldquo;legs yellow,&rdquo; it is clear that this cannot be the
Golden Eagle, which has the tarsus densely feathered. There is no North
American species known to which the original description applies.</p>

and now unknown. The description applies to a beautiful Mexican species,

only be made to Gmelin&rsquo;s compilation of Pennant&rsquo;s description. The latter,
as quoted above, and which is the original, appears to apply to <i>Falco columbarius</i>
(Linn.), but not with sufficient accuracy to be without doubt, and we
know of no bird at present inhabiting &ldquo;the province of New York&rdquo; that it

reports, rather oddly confounding the Forked-tailed Hawk (<i>Nauclerus</i>) and
the Osprey, or Fish Hawk (<i>Pandion</i>).</p>

<p>The specimen described under this name was the same that is alluded to
by Mr. Audubon in his article on the White-headed Eagle, in Orn. Biog., II.
p. 163, as being kept in captivity in the suburbs of Philadelphia, and this
description and its author he also alludes to. We mention this bird for the
purpose of facilitating the student who may not have access to the works of
Rafinesque, and for the purpose of pointing out a curious error into which
Mr. Audubon and Dr. Harlan, as quoted by him, seem to have fallen, in
regarding it as the White-headed or Bald Eagle (<i>Haliaetus leucocephalus</i>).
It is expressly stated by Rafinesque to have been brought from &ldquo;near
Buenos Ayres,&rdquo; and was evidently, from his description, the <i>Circaetus coronatus</i>
of South America. This name is therefore by no means to be cited as
a synonyme for <i>Haliaetus leucocephalus</i>.</p>

<p>The above embrace all the names and descriptions of birds of this family
that have come under our notice, except those of such as are now well ascertained
to inhabit other countries exclusively, and for which nearly allied
species of North America have been mistaken. Of the latter we may more
particularly mention the European <i>Falco rusticolus</i> (Linn.), which is given
by Fabricius as a bird of Greenland, but stated by Holboll to have been the
young of <i>F. anatum</i>, and <i>Buteo vulgaris</i> and <i>Hypotriorchis &aelig;salon</i>, both of
which are also European species, and have never been found in America to
our knowledge, though there are species which are nearly related to them.</p>
<p>The student may advantageously bear in mind that of those above, which
were originally described by Pennant, in English, abstracts or compilations
only, in Latin, are given by Gmelin in his edition of the Systema Natura of
Linn&aelig;us. These abstracts are mostly very short, and not always to be
relied on as conveying strictly the sense of the originals. Nor are they at
all improved by Turton in his edition of Linn&aelig;us, in which, so far as relates
to these species, he merely retranslates into English the Latin text of Gmelin
without reference to Pennant. In the study of the obscure species alluded
to, the original descriptions only can be consulted without risk of error.</p>

<br />PLATE XVI.&mdash;Male and Female.</h2>
<p>The researches of late naturalists have tended to demonstrate that the
animals of Western North America have a more intimate relationship with
those of Asia and the old world generally than those of the Eastern portion
of this continent. Nor is this affinity restricted, apparently, to any one
class, or to such as might have migrated, but is found to exist in a greater or
less degree in classes of animals, as that of reptiles, possessing powers of
locomotion too limited to admit of such supposition. When, too, we have
had our attention directed to the family of Sparrows and Finches, to the
beautiful Jays and Magpies, or the various species of Grouse, Partridges, and
many other families, we have been almost persuaded to entertain the opinion
that the birds of Western America are of a higher grade of organization
than those of the Atlantic States. Whether such is the case in other classes
of animals, we are not prepared to say, but, if true, it is singularly accordant
with the fact that, of the aboriginal American races of men, the West has
produced the superior. And it is remarkable, too, that there are Western
tribes which very intimately resemble the Mongolian variety of the human
race, if they do not really belong to it; thus connecting themselves with the
Chinese and Japanese, and other nations of Northern Asia.</p>
<p>The remarkable Falcon which we now have the pleasure of introducing
to the reader, is one of the species that show close affinity to an Asiatic
congener. It is so much like a common Falcon of India, a bird much used
for the purposes of falconry, and known by the name of the <i>Jugger</i>, in the
valley of the Indus and other parts of India (<i>Falco jugger.</i> Gray, Ill. of
Indian Zoology, II. pl. 26, and Jerdon, Ill. Indian Orn., pl. 44), that it can
scarcely be distinguished from it by any character, except size. It is in fact
one of the most remarkable instances of close proximity to an Asiatic relative
to be found in American birds. It is larger than the Indian <i>Jugger</i>,
and more powerful and robustly organized.</p>
<p>Though trained for the chase, the Asiatic bird alluded to is not held in as
high estimation as several others; the greatest favorites being the Peregrine
Falcon (<i>Falco peregrinus</i>), nearly related to the Duck Hawk of the Atlantic
coast of America (<i>F. anatum</i>), and the Indian Goshawk (<i>Astur palumbarius</i>),
which is also a relative of an American species. Falconry, though now little
cultivated in Europe, is yet a much-pursued and favorite pastime in several
countries of the East. In addition to the Hawks just mentioned, several
others, a few of which are more or less nearly related to species of this
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
country, are employed. Some of the smaller Hawks of India are so easily
trained that they are set free at the close of a hunting season, the Falconer
not considering them of sufficient value to induce him to keep them until
another.</p>
<p>The home of the bird now before us, appears to be the mountainous regions
of Oregon and California, from which it descends in the winter season to the
lower districts, in the valleys of the rivers, and on the shores of the Pacific.
In the former country, near the sources of the Platte river, the first specimen
that we ever saw, was obtained by the late Dr. John K. Townsend during
his trip across the continent in the year 1834, and in whose collection, now
belonging to the Philadelphia Academy, it yet remains. Since that period
it has been observed in the Rocky Mountains and on the Columbia river, by
the naturalists attached to the United States Exploring Expedition, in the
Vincennes and Peacock. In the fine zoological collection made by this expedition,
is preserved the only female specimen, in the dark plumage, described
below, yet known to have been brought to the attention of naturalists. In
California, Dr. Heermann particularly noticed this bird, and his collection
contains several specimens which he obtained in the plains near Sacramento
city.</p>

<br />The Ca&ntilde;on Finch.
<br />PLATE XVII.&mdash;Adult Male.</h2>
<p>This plain-plumaged and sober-looking bird is another of the feathered
inhabitants of the mountainous wilds of California and New Mexico. Numerous
specimens have been brought in the various collections which have been
made in those countries, and it may be regarded as one of the most abundant
of the peculiar species of Western America.</p>
<p>It was first described, however, by Mr. Swainson, from Mexican specimens.</p>
<p>Our friend, T. Charlton Henry, M. D., of the United States Army, a
zealous and talented young naturalist, who has been for some years in New
Mexico, has noticed this bird at all seasons in that country. For much
valuable and satisfactory information relating to the birds to be included in
the present work, we are indebted to this gentleman, amongst whose notes
in our possession we find the following, relating to the species now before the
reader:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bird is common in New Mexico during both summer and winter, and
so far as I have observed, lives almost entirely in the mountains. It is very
retiring in its habits, and seems to prefer the ca&ntilde;ons; indeed, I have seldom
observed it far from some shady gorge, where, like its relative of the Eastern
States, the Towhe-Bunting (<i>Pipilo erythropthalma</i>), it passes the greater part
of its time on the ground, and is generally accompanied by its congener, the
Arctic Ground Finch (<i>Pipilo arctica</i>). When disturbed, it seeks the thickest
cover, though it is by no means shy nor difficult to approach. Its nest is
usually constructed in the thick branches of a cedar or dwarf oak, and I am
not aware of its producing more than a single brood in a season.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only note that I have ever heard this bird utter, is a simple chirp,
somewhat resembling that of the Fox Sparrow (<i>F. iliaca</i>), but more subdued.
It is usually to be met with in pairs, at all seasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Col. McCall observed this bird to be abundant also in California, and with
his usual kindness, has furnished a notice of it for our present article.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>habitat</i> of this species, I am inclined to believe, extends throughout
California, as I met with it from the upper waters of the Sacramento river
to the mouth of the Gila, the former having its origin in the north, the latter
debouching at the extreme southern boundary of the State; yet, it is by far
the most abundant from Santa Barbara southwardly.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig17">

<p class="pcap">Plate 17<br /><span class="ln2">The Ca&ntilde;on Finch</span><br /><span class="ln3">Pipilo fusca (<i>Swainson</i>)</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;The habits and manners of this species differ somewhat from those of its
relatives, the Towhe and the Arctic Finch (<i>P. erythropthalmus</i>, and <i>P.
arctica</i>). Its flight is more even and regular, as it is without that violent
jerking of the tail from side to side which gives such singularity and appearance
of awkwardness to the movements of the Towhe. It is also less shy
and suspicious than the Arctic Finch, which I occasionally met with in the
same regions. The latter I had previously observed with attention in New
Mexico, where I procured specimens; and all my observations lead me to
pronounce the present species less decidedly a <i>Ground Finch</i> than either of
the others, although all are doubtless closely allied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The favorite abode of this species appeared to be the vicinity of water-courses,
where it was generally seen singly or in pairs, though I have at
times surprised eight or ten together, under the shade of a large bush, at
noon in a summer-day; and at such times I had no difficulty in procuring,
with my gun, three or four specimens before the party was dispersed. In
fact, it appeared at all times a familiar bird, boldly coming into the roads to
feed, and permitting the close approach of a person either mounted or on
foot. If compelled to retreat, it darted suddenly into the thicket, but
returned again as soon as the cause of alarm had disappeared. Near Santa
Barbara, in the month of July, I found thirty or forty of these birds dispersed
over an old field of some five acres in extent, lying contiguous to the
sea-beach, and through which a small stream of fresh water trickled as it
crept silently away to the sea. Here they were feeding on the ground,
sheltered by a rank growth of weeds; and when I flushed one of them as I
walked along, he almost invariably flew into a neighboring tree, instead of
seeking shelter again in the weeds at a little distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this time, the birds of the year were fully fledged, and scarcely
differed in the color of their plumage from the adults. The rufous tints of
the head, the wing-coverts, and the lower parts generally, being only rather
more bright and distinct in the old birds than in the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The collections made in California by both Mr. Bell and Dr. Heermann,
contained many fine specimens of this species. According to the latter (in
Journal of the Philadelphia Academy, quarto, II. p. 267), it builds its nest
always in a bush or tree, in which respect it differs from the Arctic Ground
Finch (<i>Pipilo arctica</i>), another Western species, which builds on the ground,
and from others of the same genus, in this respect confirming the observation
of Dr. Henry, as given in a preceding page. Dr. Heermann&rsquo;s observations
possess an especial interest, from his having so carefully stated the peculiarities
of the construction of the nests and other facts relating to the nidification
of many species. He says, respecting the present bird: &ldquo;I found one
nest built in a grape-vine, overhanging the Sacramento river, and all that I
have seen were placed in the immediate vicinity of water. The nest is composed
of coarse twigs and grasses, and lined with fine roots. The eggs, four
in number, are of a pale blue color, dashed with black spots, and interspersed
with a few faint neutral tint blotches, which are more abundant at the larger
end.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>The name Ca&ntilde;on Finch we have taken the liberty of adopting from Dr.
Henry&rsquo;s manuscript notes in our possession: it was very appropriately given
by him with reference to the localities which he has observed to be the
favorite haunts of this bird in the mountains of the Far West.</p>

<br />PLATE XVIII.&mdash;Adult and Young Males.</h2>
<p>This bright-plumaged little bird is a summer visitor to Texas and New
Mexico, in which countries it rears its young, and appears to be an inhabitant
also not only of Mexico, but of nearly the whole of Central and South
America. It has been long known as a bird of the last-named division of
this continent, though but recently ascertained to be a resident within the
limits of the United States, having been first observed in Texas by Captain
J. P. McCown, of the United States Army, in 1850, and announced as an
addition to the ornithology of North America, by Mr. Lawrence, in the
Annals of the New York Lyceum of Natural History, V. p. 115. In some
interesting notes on the birds of Texas, by Capt. McCown, published in the
same journal, VI. p. 12, we find the following in reference to the present
species:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This beautiful little Flycatcher is seldom seen. I did not notice over a
dozen of them while in Western Texas. I always found them near the ponds
along the Rio Grande, and generally on a tree or stake near the water. The
only nest I ever found was built upon a <i>retama</i> (a variety of acacia), over the
water, and I was not able to procure it. The female is quite a plain bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our friend, Lieut. D. N. Couch, one of the several officers of the Army
who have greatly contributed to the knowledge of the Natural History of
little-explored portions of this country, and the results of whose observations
have most generously been placed at our disposal, met with this bird in small
numbers in Northern Mexico. From many valuable papers, which will add
much to the interest of the present work, and for which we are indebted to
this gentleman, we make the following extract:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bird was first seen at Charco Escondido, in Tamaulipas, on the tenth
of March. The male had evidently preceded the female in his arrival, as the
latter was not observed until several weeks afterwards. Early in the morning,
and again about sunset, he came to the artificial lake that is constructed here
for the supplying of water to the inhabitants, and appeared to be of a very
quiet and inoffensive disposition, usually sitting on the upper branches of the
trees, occasionally uttering a low chirp. Subsequently, it was met with in
Nueva Leon, though I had little opportunity of observing its habits. It
appeared, however, to be in some respects similar in its manners to the smaller
species of the Northern Flycatchers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Henry has also met with the present bird in the vicinity of Fort
Webster, New Mexico. He represents it, however, as of exceedingly rare
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
occurrence, so far as he has observed, and fully confirms the statements given
above, respecting its partiality for the neighborhood of water. His first
specimen, a male in full plumage, was obtained on the Rio Miembres, near
Fort Webster, in the month of March, 1853.</p>

<br />The Blue Partridge. The Scaly Partridge.
<br />PLATE XIX.&mdash;Male and Female.</h2>
<p>This is another of the fine game birds that inhabit the countries on the
southwestern frontier of the United States, and the adjoining regions of
Mexico. Though not presenting such gay colors in its plumage as the two
other Partridges which we have previously figured in the present work, it is
by no means destitute of claim to respect in personal appearance, and in
gracefulness and delicacy of form is not at all their inferior. We have
always particularly admired its ample and curious crest, which is possessed
by both male and female, and, though admitting of being flattened so as to
lie close on the head, is usually to be seen erect, and gives it an air unusually
spirited and striking. It is remarkable for great swiftness in running, and is
more of an insect-eater than is usual in this family of birds. It is abundant
in Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>Specimens of this bird had reached Europe as early as 1830, in which year
it was first brought to the notice of naturalists by Mr. Vigors, one of the
founders of the Zoological Society of London, and one of the most profound
naturalists of the only school of systematic Zoology, the Circularian and
Quinarian, which Anglo-Saxon mind has yet produced, a consideration one
would think not slightly to be regarded. His description is in the Zoological
Journal, V. p. 275. It has, however, always, until within a few years, been
of great rarity in collections, and nothing was known of its history or habits
until the publication of the valuable contributions to Natural History which
have been made by officers of the Army of the United States.</p>
<p>The Blue Partridge was first noticed within the territory of the United
States, by Lieut. J. W. Abert, a son of the distinguished officer who presides
over the Topographical Department of the Army. In Lieut. Abert&rsquo;s very
able and valuable &ldquo;Report of an examination of New Mexico in the years
1846-7,&rdquo; made as an officer of Topographical Engineers, and which, besides
its great military and geographical usefulness, contains much information
relating to the natural history of that country, we find several notices of this
bird, one of which, occurring under date of twelfth of November, 1846 (p. 497),
we take the liberty of transferring to our pages:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After passing through the little town of Las Canas, we encountered
another hill of sand, very difficult of ascent, and after we reached the top, we
commenced the descent through a crooked ravine that was strewed with fragments
of rocks. On the way, we saw several flocks of crested quails, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
were running along with great rapidity among the clumps of the Kreosote
plant (<i>Larrea mexicana</i>). We procured one of them; at the report of the
gun, only three or four rose up; they seemed to depend more on their fleetness
of foot than swiftness of wing. This bird proved to be the <i>Ortyx
squamata</i>. The size, contour, and general character, greatly resemble the
common quail (<i>O. virginiana</i>); the plumage is of soft, silvery gray, the iris
hazel, and the crest fringed with white. On opening the stomach, I found it
filled with grass seeds and insects of the order Hemiptera.&rdquo; This is the
earliest record of this bird having been observed within the limits of the
United States; subsequently, it has been noticed by others.</p>
<p>Capt. S. G. French, of the United States Army, to whom we are indebted
for fine specimens of this and other birds of Western America, has also
favored us with the following note:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was in 1846 that I first met with this bird near Camargo, on the Rio
Grande. At Monterey, none were to be found; but on the plains at Agua
Nueva, a few miles south of Saltillo, I observed them in considerable numbers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since then, I have met with them occasionally on the Upper Rio Grande,
in the vicinity of El Paso, and some seventy miles down the river from that
place. They inhabit the same section of country with Gambel&rsquo;s Partridge,
though I have never seen them associated together in the same covey. Their
favorite resorts are the sandy chaparral and mesquite bushes, through which
they run with great swiftness, resorting to the wing only when suddenly
alarmed by finding themselves too nearly approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They appear to be very shy, and but seldom are found near habitations,
though I once saw a large covey run through my camp in the suburbs of El
Paso.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bird that I sent you was killed on the Rio Grande, below El Paso,
in July last (1852).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Col. McCall, in his &ldquo;Remarks on the habits, &amp;c., of birds met with in
Western Texas,&rdquo; in Proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy, V. p. 222,
thus alludes to the Blue Partridge:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This species I have met with, at different times, throughout a more
extended region than either of the former (the Massena Partridge and Gambel&rsquo;s
Partridge), viz.: from Camargo on the lower Rio Grande, to Santa F&eacute;.
On the present occasion, they were more numerous between the latter point
and Don Ana than elsewhere. They seem to prefer the vicinity of the
greater water-courses to interior tracts. They are much more wild than
either of the preceding, and being extremely watchful and swift of foot, they
elude pursuit with surprising skill, scarcely resorting to flight even in comparatively
open, sandy ground. They do not approach the settlements as
much as the last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the table, all these species, however, possess in a high degree the
requisites of plump muscle and delicate flavour. Massena is, perhaps, the
best.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>The following more extended and beautiful sketch, referring to this Partridge,
has been very kindly furnished by the same gentleman (Col. McCall),
for our present article:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>habitat</i> of this species, as I have remarked elsewhere, embraces an
extensive region, the limits of which, though not yet positively defined with
any degree of accuracy, may, at least with reference to our own territory, be
asserted to lie principally within the valley of the Rio Grande or Rio del
Norte of Mexico. This valley, although comparatively narrow, contains a
country of great extent from north to south; and embraces, in its stretch
between the Rocky Mountains and the Gulf of Mexico,&mdash;every variety of
climate, from the extreme of cold to that of tropical heat. This entire region,
not even excepting the narrow mountain-valleys, covered in winter with deep
snows, is inhabited by the species under consideration. I have met with it
on the Rio Grande and its affluents, from the 25th to the 38th degree of north
latitude&mdash;that is to say, from below Monterey, in Mexico, along the borders
of the San Juan river to its junction with the Rio Grande; and at different
points on the latter as high up as the Taos and other northern branches,
which gush from the mountain sides. I have also found it, though less frequently,
near the head of the Riado creek, which likewise rises in the Rocky
Mountains and flows eastwardly to the Canadian; further north than this my
examinations did not extend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, as the Partridge, wherever found, is always <i>resident</i>, there is in
the extensive distribution above noted, good proof of a hardiness of constitution
possessed by no other species of American Partridge, except the common
or Virginia Partridge; for no other species has been found in regions as cold
and inhospitable as those I have named. Again, arguing from analogy, if
the plainer plumage is always found in birds inhabiting more northern latitudes,
my opinion is strengthened when I look upon the plain and sober hues
of the <i>Blue</i> Partridge as contrasted with the bright and more decided colors
of the <i>Massena</i>, <i>California</i>, and <i>Gambel&rsquo;s</i> Partridges, all of which prefer the
milder regions, and shun those of snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The habits, moreover, of this species are more like those of the common
Partridge than either of the others. I have shot these birds over a pointer
dog, and at times found them to lie sufficiently close to afford good sport;
this, however, it must be admitted, was not often the case, and never, unless
the cover was remarkably good; for, in general, they are vigilant and wild,
making their escape by running on the first approach of danger. In swiftness
of foot none of the family can compete with them. When running, they keep
the body erect and hold the head high; and in this attitude they seem fairly
to skim over the surface of the ground. On such occasions the white plume
is erected and spread out like a fan, or rather like an old fashioned <i>chapeau
de bras</i>, worn fore and aft: this gives them a trim, jaunty air, that is peculiarly
pleasing and attractive. I remember once being particularly struck
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
with the beautiful appearance thus presented by a large covey that I came
upon suddenly in open sandy ground. It was in the month of February, just
at sunrise; I was half asleep on my horse, and thoroughly benumbed with
cold (having been in the saddle since two hours before daybreak, in order to
reach Eagle Spring by breakfast time), when a sudden start of my horse
roused me into wakefulness. On looking up, I beheld about twenty of these
birds in the trail a few yards in advance. Contrary to their usual manner,
they were strutting along, or rather slowly walking away; and with their
white <i>chapeaux</i> spread out to the full extent, they glanced over their shoulders
and clucked to each other as if uncertain whether danger threatened or not.
I drew up my horse and looked on with delight, until the little fellows finally
took to their heels and swiftly glided away to the nearest cover. This little
incident having restored me to full consciousness, I cast my eyes around, and
never shall I forget the sublime prospect that then burst upon my enchanted
gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A more glorious, a more heavenly dawn of day than this, it is impossible
to conceive! The heavy dew of the preceding night has been congealed, and
the whole country is white with frost. The rising sun casts his broad beams
over the vast plain, and in an instant its surface is brilliant with sparkling
crystals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The abrupt and isolated peaks, whose soft parts the frosts and storms of
past ages have loosened and swept away, seem in the distance to rear still
higher their lofty summits, now crowned with glittering diadems. On all
sides, to the farthest extent of my powers of vision, the varied prospect is
open to my view&mdash;hereaway, strongly defined, I behold the bold outline of
the Apache mountains; yonder, I regard, with admiration growing as I gaze,
the countless undulations of the prairie, each as it succeeds the other diminishing
in the distance until the last faint wave is blended with the blue horizon.
Still admiring as I turn, I find my horse at last fairly faced about; and now
another view, the grandest, the strangest of all, is presented to my almost
bewildered senses. It is the <i>mirage</i>! Wonderful illusion, cruel mockery&mdash;how
often hast thou deceived the famished wanderer of the plains with the
semblance of water; leading him on farther and farther, and leaving him at
last sinking and exhausted in the midst of the desert!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold! I clearly see a broad lake of bright water, with noble trees
growing on either hand; and nothing but the positive knowledge that this
counterfeit lake lies directly across the road over which I have just passed,
and the perfect certainty under which I rest, from actual examination, that
neither wood nor water is to be found in that direction within thirty miles,
can persuade me that what I now look upon is not real! But I will return
from this digression&mdash;yet, if this page ever meets the eyes of my two companions
on that expedition (Lieutenants B&mdash;&mdash; and M&mdash;&mdash;, of the 3d), they
will remember the glorious sunrise, the mirage, and finally, the covey of
Partridges to which I have here alluded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;This species is found farther to the south on the Mexican side of the Rio
Grande than on our own, owing probably to the rugged character of the
country there, for I never met with it anywhere in low grounds. The first
appearance it makes in Texas is a little above Rhinosa, on the first highlands
on this side encountered in ascending the river from its mouth. Thence up
to the Rocky Mountains, the birds of this species may be considered denizens
of the United States, being about equally distributed on both sides of the
great river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a paper in the &ldquo;Registro Trimestre,&rdquo; I. p. 144 (Mexico, 1832), Don
Pablo de la Llave, an able Mexican naturalist, gives a description of this bird,
and names it <i>Tetrao cristata</i>. He had kept it, with other species, in captivity,
and of his notice of it we give the following translation: &ldquo;The second
species is considerably smaller than the preceding,&rdquo; (<i>Tetrao marmorata</i>,
Llave, which is <i>Ortyx macroura</i>, Jardine and Selby). &ldquo;It has on its head a
crest of feathers very erect and soft, bill black, the neck moderate, body
elongated, much compressed, feet robust, gray or blackish, small, and have,
more than in <i>Tetrao</i>, the appearance of the Larks or Buntings. It is almost
entirely of a lead color, with the feathers of the breast speckled with black,
and those of the sides with many longitudinal bands of white. Its voice is
very much varied, and that of the male is loud, sounding like a castanet, at
the same time raising and depressing its head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not observed in this bird any courage;&mdash;it is very timid; all its
movements are rapid, and notwithstanding that I have fed my specimens for
a long time, every day they become more wild and intractable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It inhabits the <i>Mezquite</i> regions in Northern Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The contents of the stomachs of Capt. French&rsquo;s specimens were hemipterous
insects, some of which were very minute, with a few seeds and pods.</p>
<p>Our plate represents the male and female, which are nearly alike in plumage,
about two-thirds of the size of life.</p>

<br />The Western Swamp Sparrow.
<br />PLATE XX.&mdash;Adult Male.</h2>
<p>The only information that we can present to the reader respecting the
bird now before him, is, that specimens were brought from California in the
collections made by Mr. Bell and Dr. Heermann. It appears to have been
overlooked by all other naturalists,&mdash;a circumstance probably not to be
attributed to its rarity in its native country, so much as to the character of
the localities in which it lives during the greater part of the year, in common
with other species of the same family.</p>
<p>The little birds of the group to which this species belongs, of which there
are several, are all of humble and unpretending appearance, and live in the
vicinity of the shores of the ocean and the margins of streams of fresh water,
and hence have been designated Swamp Sparrows. The <i>flats</i>, or other low
and level tracts, overgrown with reedy or sedgy vegetation, in the vicinity of
the sea-shore, are the favorite resorts of two or three species throughout a
large portion of the entire extent of the Atlantic coast of the United States;
while somewhat similar localities along rivers or smaller streams, or even
swamps and marshes in the interior, afford appropriate habitations for others.
In these they subsist mainly on seeds of grasses and such other plants as
usually abound in those situations, and occasionally on insects. The Swamp
Sparrow, first described by the celebrated ornithologist, Wilson (<i>Ammodromus
palustris</i>), is the best known of these birds, and is abundant in all suitable
localities, during the summer season, throughout the greater part of the
older States of the Union. In winter, it migrates southward, and is found in
large numbers along the Mississippi river in the south, and other streams in
the southern States. The Swamp Sparrows have no song, other than a few
rather remarkable and not unmusical notes.</p>
<p>Dr. Heermann remarks of this bird: &ldquo;In the fall of 1851, I met with a
single specimen of this bird, in company with a flock of Sparrows of various
kinds. In the spring of 1852, I found it quite abundant on the Calaveras
river, where I procured several specimens. Its flight appeared feeble, and
when raised from the ground, from which it would not start until almost
trodden upon, it would fly a short distance, and immediately drop again into
the grass. Its notes are a ditty, resembling that of our Chipping Sparrow
(<i>E. socialis</i>), and were heard towards the spring season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In our plate this bird is represented of the size of life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>The plant is a western species of <i>Ipomea</i>, which was raised from the seed
by our esteemed friend, Mr. Robert Kilvington, of Philadelphia, to whose
kindness we are indebted for the privilege of figuring it and other plants for
the plates of the present work.</p>

<br />The Black-headed Oriole.
<br />PLATE XXI.&mdash;Adult Male.</h2>
<p>Again we portray an inhabitant of the land of the Mesquite and Mimosa.
This handsome, though plain Oriole, when compared with some of its brilliant
relatives of the same countries, is found throughout nearly the whole of
Mexico, and extends its range northwardly into Texas and New Mexico. Mr.
Pease, who accompanied the Army of the United States under General
Scott, in Mexico, in 1847, observed it at Jalapa, and in the neighborhood of
the city of Mexico, in considerable numbers.</p>
<p>As a bird of Texas, this species was first brought to notice by Mr. Jacob
P. Giraud, Jr., of New York, who received it in a collection of birds from that
State, in 1834, and published a description of it in his &ldquo;New Species of
North American Birds,&rdquo; p. 1 (1841). Since that time it has been found
within the limits of the United States by several naturalists, but especially by
Mr. John H. Clark, who, while attached as zoologist to the commission for
running the boundary line between the United States and Mexico, neglected
no opportunity of making investigations which have contributed much to the
natural history of the regions necessarily passed through, and whose collection
contained specimens of this species. To Mr. Clark we are indebted for the
following note respecting this species:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Approaching the lower Rio Grande from New Mexico, the Black-headed
Oriole was first seen near Ringgold Barracks, but not in abundance; and,
although of rich plumage, its quiet manners and secluded habits prevented it
from being very conspicuous. It was noticed most frequently while feeding
on the fruit of the hackberry; but whenever exposed in picking off the berries,
it always showed signs of uneasiness, and would immediately seek refuge in
places affording greater concealment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Usually, pairs were to be seen keeping close together, and they seemed
to prefer the thick foliage which occurs on the margins of the ponds or in the
old bed of the river. They did not appear to communicate with each other
by any note; indeed, I was struck with their silence, though my opportunities
for observation were limited. Their habits seemed to be very different
from those of any other Oriole with which I am acquainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This observation, by so accurate and careful an observer as Mr. Clark,
deserves especial attention. It is quite probable that this bird is the type
of a distinct group or sub-genus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>In the papers of Lieut. Couch, most kindly placed by him at our disposal,
we find the following in relation to the bird now before us:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Black-headed Oriole was seen for the first time on the third of
March, 1853, at Santa Rosalio rancho, eight leagues west of Matamoras.
It had paired, and both male and female were very shy and secluded, seeking
insects on the <i>nopal</i> (a species of prickly pear), or among the low mimosa
trees, never seeming to be at rest, but constantly on the look-out for their
favorite food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Charco Escondido, farther in the interior of Tamaulipas, this bird
was well known to the <i>rancheros</i>, who were disposed to give it a bad reputation,
stating that it often came to the rancho to steal the freshly-slaughtered
beef, hung up to dry in the sun. Whether this was true or not, I had no
opportunity of ascertaining; but my acquaintance with the Black-headed
Oriole, at this place, I have a particular reason for remembering. Early one
morning, an old man, who had daily called on me, with his wife and six nude
pickaninnies, presented himself, and wished as usual to take me to a spot
where great numbers of rare birds were to be found. Gladly assenting, we
were out of sight of the rancho at sunrise of one of the magnificent mornings
only known in tropical latitudes. It was the day after a severe <i>norther</i>, and
the whole feathered kingdom was in motion. My guide soon called my
attention to two <i>calandrias</i>, as these birds are called by the Mexicans, which
were quietly but actively seeking their breakfast. The male having been
brought down by my gun, the female flew to a neighboring tree, apparently
not having observed his fall; soon, however, she became aware of her loss,
and endeavored to recall him to her side with a simple <i>pout pou-it</i>, uttered in
a strain of such exquisite sadness, that I could scarcely believe such notes to
be produced by a bird, and so greatly did they excite my sympathy, that I felt
almost resolved to desist from making further collections in natural history,
which was one of the principal objects of my journey into the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another species that takes the place of this bird, west of Monterey, has
a more powerful, varied, and artistic song, but I have never heard the lay
of any songster of the feathered tribe expressed more sweetly than that of
the present Oriole. At Monterey, it is a favorite cage-bird. The notes of
the male are more powerful than those of the female.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My stay in Mexico was not sufficiently protracted to enable me to study
the habits of this interesting bird as fully as I could have wished. Generally,
its flight is low and rapid, and it seemed to prefer the shade of trees.
It was observed almost invariably in pairs, and the male and female showed
for each other much tenderness and solicitude. If one strayed from the other,
a soft <i>pou-it</i>, soon brought them again together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nature has, for much the greater part, denied to birds of brilliant plumage
any remarkable powers of melody, and there are many birds of great beauty,
in which the voice is harsh and uninviting, if not absolutely disagreeable.
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
Occasional exceptions occur, particularly in the families of Grosbeaks and
Finches, species of which are capable of producing short, though expressive
and musical notes, sometimes uttered in connection with each other, and
forming a partial song. Such is the case, too, with a few of the Orioles; but we
should infer from the interesting statement of Lieut. Couch, that the bird
now before us is, at least, one of the most gifted of its family, and we shall
look forward to his further investigations in Mexico, which he is now about
commencing, hoping for additional information in relation to this remarkable
species.</p>
<p>All the most celebrated songsters of the feathered kingdom are birds of
very plain plumage. The Nightingale, famed in all ages, and universally
admitted to be the most superior in vocal ability of all the birds of the world,
would attract no attention whatever from the general observer, so modest and
unpretending is its appearance. The Mocking Bird of the United States,
properly regarded as second only to the Nightingale, is scarcely less so, and
our other Thrushes, and the little <i>Vireos</i>, very respectfully to be mentioned
as vocalists, partake of the same character.</p>
<p>Mr. Pease noticed the Black-headed Oriole not only at Jalapa, but also on
the <i>tierra caliente</i>, between that city and Vera Cruz. At the season when
observed by him, it fed principally on fruits, as noticed by Mr. Clark, which
fact does not conflict with Lieut. Couch&rsquo;s statement, that it is an insect-eater;
as all the birds of the family to which this species belongs, subsist on both
fruits and insects, or are what are termed omnivorous. At Jalapa, it was
called by the Mexicans, <i>Calandria iquimite</i>, the latter word being the name
of a tree, of the fruit of which it is said to be particularly fond.</p>

<br />The Purple-throated Humming Bird.
<br />PLATE XXII.&mdash;Adult Males.</h2>
<p>The Humming Birds are peculiar to America. Until within a comparatively
recent period, about one hundred species were known to naturalists,&mdash;that
being the then considered large number enumerated in works published
as lately as within about twenty years. Discoveries of previously unknown
species in this family of birds have been numerous beyond precedent or comparison
with any other, notwithstanding the zeal and ability which ornithology
has commanded within the period mentioned. At present, there are nearly
three hundred ascertained species of Humming Birds. The large and recent
additions have resulted, in a great measure, from the exploration of regions
previously little visited or inaccessible, principally in the northern part of
South America, but also in Central America and Mexico.</p>
<p>That portion of the continent of America between the Amazon as a southern
boundary, and the Rio Grande and Gila as a northern, embracing New
Grenada and Guiana, the whole of Central America and Mexico, to which
may be added the West India Islands, appears to be the most productive of
Humming Birds. Within that range, but especially in the Republic of New
Grenada, these splendid little birds are much the most abundant, and it
embraces nearly all of the most remarkable in form and most beautiful in
plumage. Southward into Brazil and Peru, and other countries of South
America, a considerable variety of species are also found; but, in the north,
that is to say, north of the line between Mexico and the United States, we
have few species of Humming Birds, and even those give us but an imperfect
idea of the gorgeous tints of their relatives of the tropical regions of this
continent.</p>
<p>Of the natural productions of America, these birds have attracted the most
universal admiration. Nor has it been, by any means, without foundation.
Nature appears to have exhausted herself in the lavish profusion of colors
of every tint and shade with which she has adorned these gems of the
animal world. They are the most splendidly colored and at the same time
the most diminutive of birds. Almost every color known in art is to be met
with in the plumage of some one or other of the Humming Birds, and usually
with a lustre more resembling that of the most highly finished workmanship
in metal, or of the most exquisite precious stones, than the transient or easily
destroyed appendages of a delicate animal organization.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>There are, however, some species which are quite plain in their appearance,
and present little or no trace of metallic or other brilliant colors. Of these,
one large species is perfectly black; others are reddish-brown, or fulvous and
plain dark green.</p>
<p>In size, the Humming Birds vary much. The Giant Humming Bird of
Brazil, which is the largest, though one of the plainest, is about the size of
the Chimney Bird of the United States, and several fine species of the later
discoveries in this group are but little smaller. Several species are quite as
large as the House Wren. On the other hand, there are Humming Birds
little larger than the Humble Bee of our meadows; and there are many
species of Beetles and other coleopterous insects, that are much larger. The
common ruby-throated Humming Bird of the United States, is a medium-sized
species, and of respectable dimensions when compared with some of his
pigmy brethren of the far South.</p>
<p>In form, too, they vary exceedingly. Some are very slender, and apparently
feebly constituted; others are comparatively quite robust. There are
species which have bills excessively long, the <i>Sword-bearer</i> (<i>Trochilus
ensiferus</i>), which is about the size of the House Wren, has a bill longer
than its body. So entirely disproportionate does the bill of this species
appear to be, that few persons, on seeing specimens for the first time, can
avoid a suspicion that it has been artificially lengthened; and we have more
than once heard it suggested on such an occasion that this remarkable appendage
could readily have been drawn out by processes used by comb-makers.
This exceedingly long bill is, however, no inconvenience whatever to the gay
little individual who is responsible for it, luckily for him;&mdash;in fact, it assists
him admirably in procuring an entirely honest subsistence amongst the large
trumpet-flowers, and others with long tubular corollas, abundant in tropical
countries. No other known species has this organ of a length so disproportionate,
though there are several in which it is unusually long for birds of
such size. The bill is, however, scarcely of the same form and shape in any
two species. In some, it is perfectly straight and very short; in others, as we
have already observed, it is very long. Numerous others have the bill curved
downwards, or scythe-shaped, and a few species have it turned upwards, presenting
a very singular appearance.</p>
<p>Other curious appendages are to be met with in species of this family.
One group has exceedingly long tails, three or four times the length of the
body. Several Humming Birds have the outer feathers of the tail long, and
though narrow for the greater part of their length, suddenly expanded at the
end like a paddle or a spoon. These seem to form a group or sub-genus of
their own, and are also remarkable for having the upper part of the leg (the
<i>tibia</i>, and sometimes part of the <i>tarsus</i>) covered with a thick mass of white
downy feathers, presenting one of the many instances of phenomena to
which it appears almost impossible in the present state of our knowledge,
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
to assign a use in the economy of the species. The wings in all Humming
Birds are large, when compared with those of many other birds, and are
formed for long-continued and rapid flight.</p>
<p>The food of the Humming Birds is now well ascertained to be principally
insects. We regard the conclusion, also, as unavoidable, that the moisture
contained in flowers is their drink only, and not capable alone of supporting
life. The tongue appears to be the principal organ used both in capturing
insects and in procuring the fluid portion of their subsistence, and is constructed
in a manner peculiarly adapted to these purposes. It is long, and
composed of two parallel tubes (like a double-barrelled gun), furnished with
the necessary apparatus of muscles for sucking, and thus enabling the bird
to reach the drops of moisture or the fluid secretions contained very frequently
in the corollas of flowers, more abundant in some species than others.
The tongue is flattened, and sometimes barbed towards the end, or margined
with fringe-like appendages, evidently designed to be of material service in
feeding on minute flies or other small and soft insects. It admits, too, of
being darted outwards, like that of the woodpeckers, and in the manner thus
indicated it is very probable that their food is secured.</p>
<p>A large space on the throat is generally the most beautiful part of the
plumage of the birds of this family. Frequently, however, the top of the
head and the entire under parts of the body are clothed in colors of the most
surpassing brilliancy. The upper parts are usually plainer.</p>
<p>In the countries where these birds are most abundant, and even in others
of South America, some species of Humming Birds are spread over a vast
extent of territory;&mdash;other species are well known to be peculiar to quite
restricted localities. Many inhabit only the warmest districts;&mdash;others are
found only in mountain-valleys, thousands of feet above the level of the sea.
One of the most beautiful Humming Birds, the Polytmus (<i>Trochilus polytmus</i>),
a large species, having the plumage mainly of a most exquisite green, with
the top of the head jet black, and with the tail excessively long, inhabits only
the island of Jamaica, and it is quite probable that every island of the West
Indies produces species which are to be found in no other. In some sections,
they are exceedingly numerous. Mr. Gosse, in his valuable volume on the
Birds of Jamaica, mentions having seen &ldquo;no less than a hundred come successively
to rifle the blossoms within the space of half as many yards in the
course of a forenoon.&rdquo; We have been informed of instances of the ruby-topaz
Humming Bird (<i>T. moschitus</i>) having occurred in the island of Trinidad
in even greater abundance.</p>
<p>In allusion to the general abundance of these birds in the countries where
they abound, and as a sketch of their habits, we transcribe the following from
&ldquo;A Voyage up the Amazon,&rdquo; from an excellent observer and agreeable
writer, our friend, Mr William H. Edwards, of New York:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherever a creeping vine opens its fragrant clusters, or wherever a tree-flower
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
blooms, may these little birds be seen. In the garden, or in the woods,
over the water, everywhere, they are darting about;&mdash;of all sizes, from one
that might easily be mistaken for a different variety of bird, to the tiny
Hermit (<i>Trochilus rufigaster</i>), whose body is not half the size of the bees
buzzing about the same sweets. Sometimes they are seen chasing each other
in sport with a rapidity of flight and intricacy of path the eye is puzzled to
follow. Again circling round and round, they rise high in mid-air, then dart
off like light to some distant attraction. Perched upon a little limb, they
smooth their plumes and seem to delight in their dazzling hues; then starting
off leisurely, they skim along, stopping capriciously to kiss the coquetting
flowerets. Often, two meet in mid-air and fight furiously, their crests and
the feathers on their throats all erected and blazing, and altogether pictures
of the most violent rage. Several times we saw them battling with large
black bees, who frequent the same flowers, and may be supposed to interfere
often provokingly. Like lightning, our little heroes would come down, but
the coat of shining mail would ward of their furious strokes. Again and
again would they renew the attack, until their anger had expended itself by
its own fury, or until the apathetic bee, once roused, had put forth powers
that drove the invader from the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mexican Humming Birds have been, until recently, but little attended
to, and even at this time are by no means well known. In an interesting
volume by Mr. William Bullock, a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London,
&ldquo;Six Months Residence and Travels in Mexico&rdquo; (London, 1824), a work
that contains much information on the natural history, and especially the
ornithology, of that country, there is a chapter exclusively devoted to the
Humming Birds. From it, we make the following extract, which may be
regarded as the more interesting, as some of the species alluded to may be
found hereafter in those parts of the United States contiguous to Mexico:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Mexico, the species of Humming Birds are numerous. Near the
capital, on my arrival, scarcely one was to be seen; but in the month of May
and June, numbers were found in the Botanic Garden, in the centre of the
city; and, by offering a reward to the Indians, many were brought to me
alive. I had nearly seventy in cages, which, with attention and care, I kept
living for some weeks; and could I have devoted my whole attention to them,
I have no doubt of the possibility of bringing them alive to Europe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is probable the whole of them feed on insects; numbers I am certain
do so, having watched them attentively in the Botanic Garden at Mexico, in
pursuit of their minute prey; and in the yard of the house in which I
resided at Themascaltepec, where one of them took entire possession of a
pomegranate tree in blossom, on which he sat the whole day, catching the
small flies that came to the flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although, like the Robin and other birds of Europe, in a state of nature,
they are extremely tenacious of any intrusion of their own species on their
dominions, yet, in captivity, when several kinds have been confined together,
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
I never observed the least inclination to quarrel, but have seen the smaller
take what appeared to be unwarrantable liberties with those of five times
their size and strength;&mdash;thus, when the perch has been occupied by the
great blue-throated one, the diminutive Mexican Star has settled on the long
beak of the former, and remained perched on it some minutes, without its
offering to resist the insult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Europeans who have seen only the stuffed remains of these little feathered
gems in museums, have been charmed with their beautiful appearance; but
those who have examined them whilst living, displaying their moving crests,
throats, and tails, like the peacock in the sun, can never look with pleasure
on their mutilated forms. I have carefully preserved about two hundred
specimens, in the best possible manner, yet they are still but the shadow of
what they were in life. The reason is obvious; for the sides of the lamin&aelig;,
or fibres of each feather, being of a different color from the surface, will
change when seen in a front or oblique direction; and as each lamina or fibre
turns upon the axis of the quill, the least motion, when living, causes the
feathers to change suddenly to the most opposite hues. Thus the one from
Nootka Sound (<i>T. rufus</i>) changes its expanded throat from the most vivid
fire color to light green; the topaz-throated does the same, and the Mexican
Star changes from bright crimson to blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sexes vary greatly in the plumage in many species, so much so, that
it is with difficulty we recognize them. The male and female of the Mexican
Star (<i>Cynanthus Lucifer</i>) could not have been known had they not been
seen constantly together, and proved to be so by dissection. They breed in
Mexico in June and July, and the nest is a beautiful specimen of the architectural
talent of these birds; it is neatly constructed with cotton or the
down of thistles, to which is fastened on the outside, by some glutinous substance,
a white flat lichen resembling ours. The female lays two eggs, perfectly
white, and large for the size of the bird, and the Indians informed me
they were hatched in three weeks, by the male and female sitting alternately.
When attending their young, they attack any bird indiscriminately that
approaches the nest. Their motions, when under the influence of anger or
fear, are very violent, and their flight rapid as an arrow; the eye cannot
follow them, but the shrill, piercing shriek which they utter on the wing, may
be heard when the bird is invisible, and often led to their destruction by
preparing me for their approach. They attack the eyes of the larger birds,
and their sharp needle-like bill is a truly formidable weapon in this kind of
warfare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing can exceed their fierceness when one of their own species
invades their territory during the breeding season. Under the influence of
jealousy, they become perfect furies; their throats swell, their crests, tails,
and wings, expand; they fight in the air (uttering a shrill noise), till one falls
exhausted to the ground. I witnessed a combat of this kind near Otumba,
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
during a heavy fall of rain, every separate drop of which I supposed sufficient
to have beaten the puny warriors to the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In sleeping, they frequently suspend themselves by the feet, with their
heads downwards, in the manner of some parrots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These birds were great favorites with the ancient Mexicans. They used
the feathers as ornaments for their superb mantles in the time of Montezuma,
and in embroidering the pictures so much extolled by Cortez. Their name
signifies, in the Indian language, beams or locks of the sun. The feathers
are still worn by the Indian ladies as ornaments for the ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be properly remarked here that the statement made by Mr.
Bullock, of the habit of these birds sleeping with their heads downwards, has
attracted considerable attention, and it has been thought probable that he
may have been mistaken, or misinformed, not having been confirmed by
subsequent naturalists. It may, however, apply only to some species.</p>
<p>The pugnacity of these little birds is almost universally alluded to by
writers who have enjoyed opportunities of observing them in the countries
where they abound. A Humming Bird of any size, even the smallest, is not
on that account less a fighting character, and jealous of whatever rights and
privileges he considers himself entitled to. But as both of the authors above
quoted, have alluded to this point, we beg the indulgence of the reader to lay
before him another extract especially relating to this hostility of disposition,
and happily illustrative of the fights and feuds of the Humming Birds. It is
from the very pleasant and valuable little work, previously mentioned, on the
Birds of Jamaica, by Mr. Philip Henry Gosse; and the species alluded to,
the Mango Humming Bird (<i>T. mango</i>), is one which is considerably larger
than the common ruby-throated species of the United States. It is abundant
in the West Indies, and in some parts of South America, and it occasionally
visits the shores of Florida. It is figured by Mr. Audubon:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Mango Humming Bird had, every day, and all day long, been paying
his <i>devoirs</i> to these charming blossoms&rdquo; (the Malay apple, <i>Eugenia malaccensis</i>).
&ldquo;On the morning to which I allude, another came, and the
man&oelig;uvres of these two tiny creatures became highly interesting. They
chased each other through the labyrinth of twigs and flowers, till, an opportunity
occurring, the one would dart with seeming fury upon the other, and
then with a loud rustling of their wings, they would twirl together, round
and round, until they nearly came to the earth. It was some time before I
could see, with any distinctness, what took place in these tussles; their twirlings
were so rapid as to baffle all attempts at discrimination. At length, an
encounter took place pretty close to me, and I perceived that the beak of the
one grasped that of the other, and thus fastened, both whirled round and
round in their perpendicular descent, the point of contact being the centre
of the gyrations, till, when another second would have brought them both to
the ground, they separated, and the one chased the other for about a hundred
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
yards, and then returned in triumph to the tree, where, perched on a
lofty twig, he chirped monotonously and pertinaciously for some time;&mdash;I
could not help thinking, in defiance. In a few minutes, however, the banished
one returned, and began chirping no less provokingly, which soon
brought on another chase and another tussle. I am persuaded that these
were hostile encounters, for one seemed evidently afraid of the other, fleeing
when the other pursued, though his indomitable spirit would prompt the chirp
of defiance; and, when resting after a battle, I noticed that this one held
his beak open, as if panting. Sometimes they would suspend hostilities to
suck a few blossoms, but mutual proximity was sure to bring them on again
with the same result. In their tortuous and rapid evolutions, the light from
their ruby necks would now and then flash in the sun with gem-like radiance;
and as they now and then hovered motionless, the broadly-expanded tail,&mdash;whose
outer feathers are crimson-purple, but when intercepting the sun&rsquo;s
rays, transmit orange-colored light&mdash;added much to their beauty. A little
<i>Banana Quit</i> (<i>Certhiola flaveola</i>), that was peeping among the blossoms in
his own quiet way, seemed now and then to look with surprise on the combatants;
but when the one had driven his rival to a longer distance than usual,
the victor set upon the unoffending Quit, who soon yielded the point, and
retired, humbly enough, to a neighboring tree. The war, for it was a
thorough campaign, a regular succession of battles, lasted fully an hour, and
then I was called away from the post of observation. Both of the Humming
Birds appeared to be adult males.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the United States, there have been discovered as yet not more than five
species of Humming Birds, including that which is presented to the reader
in our present plate. They are the ruby-throated Humming bird (<i>Trochilus
colubris</i>), which is the much-admired little species everywhere common in the
summer-time, in the States on the Atlantic; the Mango Humming Bird
(<i>T. mango</i>), an abundant South American and West Indian species that
occasionally visits Florida, as above stated; the Anna Humming Bird
(<i>T. Anna</i>), a species of California and Mexico, the most beautiful of the
northern species, and which derives additional interest from the fact that it
was named by an eminent French naturalist, in honor of Anna, Duchess of
Rivoli, whose husband, General Massena, Duke of Rivoli, the distinguished
officer of the armies of the Emperor Napoleon I., founded the ornithological
collection which now belongs to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.
In addition to these, are the rufous-throated or Northern Humming
Bird (<i>T. rufus</i>), a western species, which extends its range on the Pacific
coast to a high northern latitude, and the bird now before us. Another
species or two have been named as inhabiting California, without it being
stated whether the upper or lower divisions of that country was intended.
They are not known to inhabit that portion which is one of the States of this
Union, though it is quite probable that others of the numerous Mexican
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
species will be found extending their range into the western and southwestern
territories.</p>
<p>Within the limits of the United States, the Humming Bird now before the
reader, has been noticed only by Dr. Heermann, whose fine collection made
in California contained numerous specimens. He detected it in one locality
only, which was the burying-ground at Sacramento city. There several pairs
remained during the season of incubation, and reared their young, finding
suitable food and protection amongst the flowering plants, with which, with
great feeling and propriety, that last resting-place of the emigrant and
stranger has been adorned.</p>
<p>Dr. Heermann represents the nest as composed of fine mosses, lined with
the feathery down of various seeds, and containing two white eggs. He saw
this bird also at Guaymas, in Mexico.</p>
<p>The figures in our plate are of the size of life, and represent adult males.
The plant represented is <i>Odontoglossum Cervantesii</i>, a native of Mexico.</p>

of the old genus <i>Trochilus</i>, which is, however, given so differently by late
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
authors, that we have not at present determined the relative claims of either.
It is given by one as belonging to the genus <i>Mellisuga</i>, and by another as
<i>Trochilus</i> proper, in a restricted sense.</p>
<p>The study of the Humming Birds, now difficult, will be rendered easy by
Mr. Gould&rsquo;s great work on these birds, now in the course of publication. All
the known species are to be figured of the size of life; and in the parts already
published, the drawing and coloring is exceedingly accurate, and magnificent
beyond any precedent in the literature of ornithology.</p>
<p>In the old world, the Humming Birds are represented by the Sun Birds
(genus <i>Cinnyris</i>, Cuvier; <i>Nectarinia</i> of some authors), numerous species of
which inhabit Africa and Southern Asia. They partake in some measure of
the habits of the Humming Birds, and also of their lustrous colors, many of
the species being very beautiful.</p>
<p>Several naturalists and admirers of ornithology have formed special collections
of Humming Birds, and there are now extant several which contain
very nearly all the known species, of which may be mentioned those of Mr.
Edward Wilson, and Mr. John Gould, in England, and of Messrs. Edward
and Jules Verreaux, in Paris. That of the first named, who is an American
gentleman resident in England, is the most extensive and complete, and
includes several of the only specimens known of the species which they represent.
This gentleman and his brother, Dr. Thomas B. Wilson, of Philadelphia,
have won for themselves the imperishable respect and gratitude of
American naturalists, by forming in their native city the most extensive
library and collections in natural history in America, and, in some departments,
unrivalled by any in the old world. For these, now constituting, mainly,
the magnificent museum and library of the Academy of Natural Sciences of
Philadelphia, it is indebted to the distinguished patrons of zoological science
whom we have just mentioned.</p>

<p>It appears to be extensively diffused throughout Mexico, Texas, and New
Mexico, and in the former country is a common species. In the States last
mentioned, it has been noticed by nearly all the naturalists who have visited
them; though, as a bird of the United States, little beyond the fact of its
existence in those regions has been placed on record, or has otherwise come
to our knowledge.</p>
<p>In Mexico, this bird was found by Lieut. Couch to be numerous in some
parts of Tamaulipas, Nueva Leon, Coahuila, and other States on the Rio
Grande, immediately south and west of the limits of the territory of the
United States. For our present article, this gentleman has very kindly furnished
the following interesting communication, for which and other similar
favors we beg to tender our grateful acknowledgments:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bird was first seen at Santa Rosalio, and specimens were obtained.
Though a month had been spent at Brownsville, in Texas, only about twenty
miles distant, it had not been observed. At Charco Escondido, forty miles
farther in the interior, it was very plentiful, and early in March, seemed to
have already reared a breed of young; one specimen procured, having the
appearance of being a young bird but a few weeks old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its favourite home appears to be the scattered Mesquite or Acacias that
sprinkle the plains east of the Sierra Madre. Like many other birds of its
family, it does not seek the shade during the warmer hours of mid-day,
but may always be found chirping and hopping from one bush to another,
apparently as much for the pleasure of enjoying the society of its fellows as
to seek for food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After striking south from Cadorcita, this little bird suddenly disappeared,
much to my regret, as I had become so accustomed to seeing it constantly
during my daily marches, that I almost regarded it as a travelling companion.
But after nearly a month&rsquo;s absence, I again recognized it among some flowering
<i>Leguminosa</i>, between Pesqueria and Rinconada. I afterwards ascertained
that it would thus be entirely absent from districts of considerable
extent, but always reappeared again throughout my journey, and was always
welcome.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;The usual note of this bird at the season in which I saw it, is a simple
chirp; but one day, having halted during a <i>norther</i>, in the State of Tamaulipas,
I amused myself watching a party of adult and young birds of this
species, in the neighboring bushes. One gay little black-throated fellow, who
was probably the father, showed unusual uneasiness at my presence, which
fact led me particularly to observe him. After carefully reconnoitering and
apparently satisfying himself that there was no immediate danger, he flew
off a few yards to the top of a yellow mimosa then in bloom, and, regardless
of the bitter wind still blowing, gave utterance to a strain of sprightly and
sweet notes, that would have compared favorably with those of many a more
famed songster of the feathered race. This was the only time that I ever
heard this species indulge in anything more than a single chirp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This little Finch was observed at various localities in Texas by gentlemen
attached to the commission for running the boundary line between the United
States and Mexico.</p>
<p>The figure in our plate, which is that of an adult male from Lieut. Couch&rsquo;s
collection, is about two-thirds of the size of life.</p>
<p>The plant represented is <i>Spirea Douglasii</i>, a native of western North
America.</p>

as would render it liable to be confounded with it. It may be easily recognised
when adult by its black throat, bordered on each side by a conspicuous

stripe over the eye. In the young there is no vestige of the black throat,
that part being of a uniform color with the under parts of the body, but
bears a strong general resemblance to the adult. It is related to the group
designated <i>Euspiza</i> by authors, though it is probably the type of a distinct
subdivision.</p>

<br />The Black-headed Flycatcher.
<br />PLATE XXIV.&mdash;Adult Male.</h2>
<p>On account of their modest attire and sylvan habits, the birds of the group
to which the present species belongs, are seldom noticed by the general
observer, though some of them are to be met with commonly during the
summer, in nearly all parts of the United States. But though inconspicuous
in appearance, they make ample compensation by the loudness of their notes,
which, after the early love-songs of the Thrushes, and other of our songsters
of spring, have subsided into the more serious duties of parental responsibility,
are to be heard above those of any other of our resident birds. They are
active insect-catchers, and may be seen at nearly all hours of the day,
patiently searching amongst the leaves and branches of the trees in almost
every woodland, hopping from branch to branch, or sometimes making short
sallies in pursuit of fugitive moths or butterflies, and occasionally pausing to
refresh themselves with a rather quaint but very melodious warble, lengthened
in the spring into a cheerful and agreeable song.</p>
<p>The red-eyed Flycatcher (<i>V. olivaceus</i>) is the most numerous, and not
only is constantly to be met with in the woods, but ventures confidently into
the public squares or parks, and the yards and gardens of the cities. In many
such localities in Philadelphia, several of which are in the denser parts of the
city, this little warbler rears its young, and pipes out his sprightly song, in
entire security, and apparently feeling himself as much at home as if in the
recesses of the most remote forest. The warbling Flycatcher (<i>V. gilvus</i>) is
another pleasing singer, though in our opinion but an indifferent performer
compared with the preceding. A species common in the West Indies, and
which has been found in Florida, has some very singular notes, from one
combination of which he has had assigned to him a name quite as singular,
the &ldquo;Whip Tom Kelly&rdquo; (<i>V. altiloquus</i>).</p>
<p>The immediate relatives, however, of the little species before the reader in
the present plate, are birds that rarely venture far from the woods. One of
them, the White-eyed Flycatcher (<i>V. noveboracensis</i>), has a partiality for
marshes and low grounds producing thick growths of vines and shrubbery;
and although the smallest of his tribe has some quite remarkable notes, and
so loud, that a person not sufficiently acquainted with him to recognise his
voice, would be surprised to find such a high-sounding solo proceed from such
a diminutive performer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>The species represented in our present plate is an inhabitant of Texas, but
it has as yet been only observed in a very limited district. It was discovered
by S. W. Woodhouse, M. D., of Philadelphia, while attached to Capt. Sitgreave&rsquo;s
Surveying party. It is the handsomest bird of this group.</p>
<p>The following notice of this bird by Dr. Woodhouse, we take the liberty
of extracting from Sitgreave&rsquo;s report of an expedition down the Zu&ntilde;i and
Colorado rivers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the twenty-sixth of May, 1851, while encamped on the Rio San
Pedro, within about ten miles of its source, I was out in pursuit of specimens.
Wandering about the hills among some cedars (<i>Juniperus</i>), my attention was
first attracted by a singular note, which I am unable to describe; on looking,
I discovered this beautiful little bird, which I at first took to belong to that
interesting family of fly-catching warblers, <i>Sylvania</i>, it being constantly in
motion. It was with the greatest difficulty that I could procure specimens;
two, however, I secured, both of which, on dissection, proved to be males.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. John H. Clark, zoologist attached to the Mexican boundary commission,
who observed this species in Texas, and near the same locality at which
it was found by Dr. Woodhouse, has very obligingly made for us the following
note from his journal:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My attention was drawn to this bird by a shrill, discontented chirp which
accompanied its incessant motion in pursuit of insects. Three specimens
only were seen, and all of them at one locality, near the head of the Rio San
Pedro, or Devil&rsquo;s River, to the valley of which it appeared to be confined,
for, being aware of its novelty to the fauna of the United States, I kept a
strict look-out, but did not meet with it elsewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not at all shy, showing no concern when approached within a few
rods. The procuring of a specimen was, however, a matter of some difficulty,
as its constantly hopping or flying from branch to branch rendered an unobstructed
shot the next thing to an impossibility. It was found in June, and
the specimen obtained by me, now in the collection of the commission, is that
of a male.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our figure is of the natural size.</p>

<br />The Brown-headed Creeper.
<br />PLATE XXV.&mdash;Adult Male.</h2>
<p>This is a species belonging to a large family of birds, very numerous in
the tropical and southern regions of the American continent, though of which
not more than two species are known to venture so far north as to come
within the limits of the United States. They subsist on insects, which they
capture on the trunks and branches of trees, or, in the countries where such
plants abound, on the large species of <i>Cactus</i>, and others of a similar
character.</p>
<p>Some of the larger birds of this group have very long and singularly curved
bills, which it is supposed are peculiarly adapted to searching for insects in
the deep furrows or interstices of the rough barks of trees. All have more
or less strong feet and claws, designed for their manner of creeping on trees,
somewhat similar to that of the Woodpeckers, but more like the Nuthatches,
or little Sapsuckers, as they are commonly designated in the United States,
and the Brown Creeper of our woods (<i>Certhia americana</i>). The latter is in
fact the only northern representative of the family to which our present
species belongs, but so small, that it conveys but a faint idea of the form and
colors of these birds generally. They are, however, for the greater part,
birds of plain colors, frequently brown of various shades, or snuff-colored.</p>
<p>The bird figured in the present plate was first noticed in Texas, by Capt.
J. P. McCown, of the United States Army, and is given by Mr. Lawrence as
an addition to the ornithology of the North in the Annals of the New York
Lyceum of Natural History, V. p. 114 (1851), but with no account of its
habits. Since that time, it has been again observed by Mr. Clark at several
localities in Texas, and is known to be of frequent occurrence in the States
of Mexico immediately south of the Rio Grande, and in other parts of the
same country.</p>
<p>The Brown-headed Creeper was seen by Dr. Heermann in Mexico, and
in his paper in the Journal of the Philadelphia Academy, II. p. 263, he thus
mentions it:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;I found this bird in the arid country back of Guaymas, on the Gulf of
California. The country itself is the picture of desolation, presenting a
broken surface, and a confused mass of volcanic rocks, covered by a scanty
vegetation of thorny bushes and <i>cacti</i>. In this desert I found several interesting
species, which enter into our fauna as birds of Texas, and this species
was one of the number. It appeared to be a lively, sprightly bird, uttering
at intervals a clear, loud, ringing note. The nest, composed of grasses, and
lined with feathers, was in the shape of a long purse, laid flat between the
forks or on the branches of a <i>Cactus</i>. The entrance was a covered passage,
varying from six to ten inches in length. The eggs, six in number, are of a
delicate salmon color, very pale, and often so thickly speckled with ash and
darker salmon-colored spots, as to give a rich cast to the whole surface of the
egg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the original description of this bird by the Baron La Fresnaye, an eminent
French ornithologist, in Guerin&rsquo;s Magazine of Zoology, 1835, p. 61
(Paris), his specimen is represented as being probably from California. It
has not been noticed in that country by either of our American naturalists,
though found by Dr. Heermann, as above stated, near Guaymas, in Northern
Mexico.</p>

<br />PLATE XXVI.&mdash;Adult and Young.</h2>
<p>This is one of the largest and most handsomely plumaged of the Rapacious
birds of North America, though belonging to a division characterized by
heavy and comparatively slow flight, and not manifesting any considerable
degree of that courage and cunning which are generally so remarkable in this
great group of the ornithological kingdom. In fact, on examination of the
fine bird now before us, or of the Black Hawk of the Atlantic States, which
is nearly related to it, one would scarcely infer that the object of such an
admirable organization is nothing more important than the destruction of the
smallest and most defenceless of quadrupeds or of reptiles. Yet such is
apparently the case; many of the birds of this group, though powerful in
structure, and furnished with the usual apparatus of strong and sharp bills
and claws, and other accompaniments of predatory habits, rarely attack any
animal more formidable than a mouse or ground-squirrel, or in some cases a
frog or other of the weaker species of reptiles.</p>
<p>It is, however, entirely erroneous to attribute a noble or generous character
to any of the predatory animals, though from an early period of history
several species have been so regarded. On the contrary, there is in all these
classes, whether of birds or of other animals, a marked absence of the very
traits which are in some measure assigned to them, and even more unmistakably
so in some of the more celebrated, as the Eagles and Lions, than in
the more humble species. Yet the rapacious animals present a study in
natural history of deep interest. Owing the sustaining of their existence
for the greater part to rapine and violence, yet holding an important place
in the great design of the physical universe, they appear to personate a principle,
if we may be allowed to use the expression, involving one of the most
momentous and mysterious of problems, the existence of evil in the world.
The prowling and treacherous Lion, and the robber Wolf, have unfortunately
but too strong analogies in that race which is the head of the visible creation,
and they and their kind everywhere present the same intrinsic meanness
which is characteristic of violence and injustice, of vice and of crime amongst
men.</p>
<p>The bird now before the reader is, so far as known, exclusively a Western
species. It was first made known to American naturalists by Mr. Edward
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
M. Kern of this city, who, when attached as artist to Colonel Fr&eacute;mont&rsquo;s
Expedition of 1846, obtained it in California and brought home specimens in
a collection made by him, of the birds of that country. It had however been
previously noticed and described as a bird of California by Professor Lichtenstein,
a distinguished European naturalist, in a paper on the natural history
of that country, in the Transactions of the Royal Academy of Berlin (1838,
p. 428).</p>
<p>Since Mr. Kern, the only American naturalist who has noticed this bird is
Dr. Heermann, who has met with it during both of his visits to California, but
especially during his connection with a party under command of Lieut. Williamson,
of the U. S. Topographical Engineers, which has recently completed an
examination and survey for a route for a Railroad to the Pacific Ocean through
the southern portion of the territory of the United States. For our present
article, Dr. Heermann has with great kindness allowed us to make the following
extract from his journal, kept during the survey to which we have
alluded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;During a previous visit to California, I had seen this species in the
valley of the Sacramento river, and had considered it as rare in that section
of the country, but during the recent survey in which I have been engaged
in the southern part of the state, I found it very abundant, and on one
occasion saw five or six individuals in view at the same moment, in the mountains,
about sixty miles east of San Diego. It was there much more frequently
seen than any other species.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As large tracts of that country inhabited by this bird are often entirely
without trees, it alights on the ground or on some slightly elevated tuft of
grass or a stone, where it sits patiently for hours watching for its prey. Its
food, on dissection, I found to consist almost entirely of small quadrupeds,
principally various species of mice, and in one instance the crop was filled
with the remains of a ground-squirrel. In plumage it appears to vary as
much as its allied species, <i>A. sancti-johannis</i>. One specimen, which was shot
by a soldier attached to our party, had the tail strongly tinged with the red
color which characterizes that appendage in the red-tailed Hawk, (<i>B. borealis</i>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have several times seen a bird sailing over the prairies, about the size
of the present species, but with its entire plumage deep-black and of heavy
and continued flight. It was I think certainly of this genus; but never having
been so fortunate as to have procured a specimen, I am unable to decide
whether it was this bird, the Black Hawk (<i>A. sancti-johannis</i>), or a new
species to add to this group. My impression is that it was the Black Hawk,
but it may have been the present in a stage of plumage yet undescribed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nest and eggs of the present bird I procured on the Consumnes
river, in 1851. The nest was in the forks of an oak and was composed of
coarse twigs and lined with grasses; the eggs, two in number, were white,
marked with faint brown dashes. This nest was placed in the centre of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
large bunch of <i>Misletoe</i>, and would not have been discovered, but having
occasion to climb the tree to examine some Magpie&rsquo;s nests, the Hawk in flying
off betrayed her retreat. The eggs of this species are quite different from
those of the European <i>A. lagopus</i>, but with those of <i>A. sancti-johannis</i>, I
have never had an opportunity of comparing them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Kern&rsquo;s specimens are marked as having been procured in the Tulavie
valley, California, in January, 1846. He observes, in his notes in our possession,
that finding this bird remarkably fat and in excellent general condition,
some of the party shot it for the mess-kettle whenever opportunity
offered, and found it &ldquo;very good eating.&rdquo; Possibly under stress of capital
appetites.</p>

<br />PLATE XXVII.&mdash;Male and Female.</h2>
<p>This delicate little bird is an inhabitant of Texas, where it was first
noticed by Capt. J. P. McCown, of the U. S. Army. He obtained it near
Ringgold Barracks, in 1850, since which period specimens have been brought
in the collections of various other officers and naturalists. It is also known
as a bird of Mexico.</p>
<p>This species belongs to a small group of little fly-catching birds, of which
several others are found in America, though two of them only come within
the limits of the fauna of the United States. Of these, one, the little blue
gray Flycatcher (<i>Culicivora c&oelig;rulea</i>), has been long known as a summer
resident in the woods and forests of the Middle and Northern States, and is
one of the earliest to return, from its winter journey in the south, to its
northern home. The other is the bird now before the reader.</p>
<p>These little Flycatchers are amongst the smallest of our native birds.
They almost exclusively inhabit the woods, and are constantly seen actively
engaged in the capture of the minute insects on which they feed, in pursuit
of which they search very industriously, not only shrubbery, but trees of
the greatest height. The present is the smaller of the two northern species,
and is represented in our plate of the size of life.</p>
<p>For the following memorandum relating to this little bird we are again
indebted to the kindness of Dr. Heermann:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I first met with this species near San Diego, California, in 1851, and
during the recent survey found it abundant in the vicinity of Fort Yuma.
Its habits much resemble those of the Blue-gray Gnat-catcher of the Eastern
States (<i>Culicivora c&oelig;rulea</i>), it is very quick in its movements, searching
actively for food, preferring, apparently, the low trees and bushes, and at
times darting about in the air in pursuit of small insects. The only note
that I ever heard it utter was a chirp, so feeble in its tone that it could be
heard but a short distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last specimen procured by me was shot in a hedge bordering a field
cultivated by the Pimos Indians, whose village is situated about two hundred
miles above the junction of the Gila and Colorado rivers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The figures in the present plate, which we regard as those of adult male
and female, are of the size of life.</p>
<p>The plant is <i>Zauschneria californica</i>, a native of California.</p>

<br />PLATE XXVIII.&mdash;Adult Male.</h2>
<p>We have the pleasure of presenting to the reader, in the plate now before
him, one of the most singular of the birds of the family of Crows and Jays
yet known to inhabit North America.</p>
<p>This bird was discovered in the Rocky Mountains, by that learned and
enthusiastic naturalist, Maximilian, Prince of Wied, who in the course of
travels in North America, and especially in the interior, contributed a large
amount of valuable information relating to the natural history of the northern
portion of our continent, as he had previously to that of South America.
Few books, in fact, contain more important observations in the various
departments of North American Zoology than the work of that nobleman,
&ldquo;Travels in the Interior of North America,&mdash;edition in German, Coblenz,
1839;&rdquo; but, unfortunately, and certainly without his approbation, nearly
everything relating to natural history is omitted in the English edition,
London, 1843. In Ornithology, the works of the Prince Maximilian are
particularly valuable, and in that relating to North America, there are many
notices of little known and interesting species, and the first descriptions of
some which have since been regarded as previously unknown by American
writers.</p>
<p>The present bird differs in generic as well as specific characters from all
other forms of the family to which it belongs. Its short, heavy figure
approximates it somewhat to the Nut-crackers of the old world (<i>Nucifraga</i>),
and to Clark&rsquo;s Crow of Western America (<i>Picicorvus columbianus</i>), and its
habits, so far as known, are in some respects similar to those of the latter.
It does not appear, however, to be in any considerable degree a fruit-eater,
but is decidedly carnivorous, and almost rapacious; preying on Reptiles, particularly
the various species of <i>Phrynosoma</i>, or Horned Frogs, as they are
called with but little propriety, which abound in Western North America.
It appears, in fact, to resemble in habits, to some extent, the reptile-eating
Kingfishers (<i>Genus Todiramphus</i>) of Asia, the Pacific islands and Australia,
and if not absolutely allied, is certainly a strongly analogous representative
of those curious birds.</p>
<p>The first specimens of this bird which were brought to the attention of
American naturalists, were sent to the Philadelphia Academy, by Mr. Edward
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
M. Kern, who procured them during his connection with Col. Fr&eacute;mont&rsquo;s
Expedition of 1846; and previously no others appear to have reached Europe,
than those of its discoverer, the Prince Maximilian.</p>
<p>More recently it has been observed by several of the naturalists who have
visited Western America. Our friend, T. Charlton Henry, M. D., of the
United States&rsquo; Army, has noticed it repeatedly in the vicinity of Fort Webster,
in New Mexico. To him we have the pleasure of expressing our obligations
for the following interesting notes relating to this bird, as well as for
many others:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This singular and handsome Jay, I first met with near San Miguel, in
July, 1852, where I observed a party of some twenty or thirty specimens
flitting through the cedars along the roadside. They were mostly young
birds, and constantly alighted on the ground, for the purpose, as I ascertained,
of capturing lizards, which they killed with great readiness and devoured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since that time, I have frequently observed this bird in the winter only,
in the neighborhood of Fort Webster, and always in flocks of about forty or
fifty; indeed I am not sure that I have not repeatedly fallen in with the same
flock, and it may not therefore be as abundant as I am inclined to suppose.
Here they evince an exceeding wariness and are very difficult to approach;
I have chased a flock for hours without succeeding in getting within gun-shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost invariably a flock alights near the summit of a hill, and passes
down its side rapidly, all the birds keeping quite near to each other, and individuals
frequently alighting on the ground, when their attention is attracted
by their favorite food. They appear to be very social and keep up a continued
twittering note. I have occasionally seen them flying in close flocks,
high in the air, and apparently passing from one mountain or hill to another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bird, so far as I have seen, is exclusively a mountain species, as I
have never observed it in the plains or the bottom lands, which are the usual
haunts of its relatives, Steller&rsquo;s and the California Jay. It differs, however,
from them in many respects, and is the only species of these birds that I have
never met with singly or in parties of half-a-dozen individuals only. I have
always seen it in large flocks. Its food appears to be exclusively reptiles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>C. B. R. Kennerly, M. D., a young naturalist of great promise, who was
attached as Zoologist to Lieut. Whipple&rsquo;s party, for surveying a route for a
railroad to the Pacific Ocean, brought fine specimens of the bird now before
us, in the large and highly interesting collection of birds made by him in the
countries traversed by the expedition. To Dr. Kennerly we are indebted for
the following notice of this species:</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the march of our party from the Rio Grande to the Sierra Madre,
we saw this bird nearly every day. At that season, which was November,
large flocks were constantly found in the vicinity of the running streams,
which on being frightened from the low bushes, circled around, loudly uttering
their peculiar cry, and rising higher and higher, until they reached the summit
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
of some tree on the rocky hills. When settled, they continued their discordant
notes, which somewhat resemble some of those of the common Cat-bird
(<i>Mimus felivox</i>).&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince Maximilian&rsquo;s specimens of this bird were obtained on Maria&rsquo;s
river, one of the tributaries of the Upper Missouri, in the northern part of
the possessions of the United States in Western America, and much farther
north than it has been observed by either of the late naturalists. It probably
inhabits a very extensive district, the limits of which cannot at present be
conjectured.</p>
<p>The figure in the present plate is that of the adult male, and is about two-thirds
of the natural size.</p>

exhibited in the nearly complete collection of Jays in the museum of the

ornithologist. He observed it in the vicinity of Santa F&eacute;, in considerable
numbers.</p>
<p>Although as we have said above, nearly the whole of the valuable Zoological
notes in the German edition of the Prince Maximilian&rsquo;s Travels, are
omitted in the English translation; two notices of the present species may
be found in the latter, pp. 287, 297, the last of which is the description, and
seems to have accidentally escaped the singular want of judgment which
induced the omissions to which we allude.</p>

<br />The Black Flycatcher.
<br />PLATE XXIX.&mdash;Adult Male and Female.</h2>
<p>This gracefully formed, but sombre-colored little bird was first added to
the Ornithological fauna of the United States, by our valued friend, Colonel
George A. McCall, Inspector General in the Army of the United States, who
observed it, and obtained numerous specimens, while on a tour of duty in
California, in 1852. It had previously been known as a Mexican species,
having been described by Mr. Swainson, in 1838, from specimens sent from
that country.</p>
<p>This bird belongs to a small group of Fly-catchers, containing not more
than five or six species, all of which are inhabitants of either Western North
America, Mexico, or the southern portion of this continent. They appear to
possess the habits of true Fly-catchers, and are remarkable for their slender
but active forms, in which the long and ample tail and the elongated feathers
of the head, capable of being erected into a handsome crest, are generally
conspicuous. The best known North American species is <i>Ptilogonys obscurus</i>,
La Fresnaye (which is <i>Ptilogonys Townsendii</i>, Audubon), a bird that
is now brought from the far west by nearly all collectors.</p>
<p>Respecting the curious little species which is the subject of our present
article, we have the pleasure of laying before the reader the following notes
very kindly furnished by Col. McCall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first opportunity that I had for observing the manners of this bird,
was afforded me in 1852, while travelling from <i>Valle-cita</i> to <i>El Chino</i>, in
California. On that occasion, as I left the country bordering the desert, and
began to ascend the hills, my route followed the course of a mountain brook,
whose clear waters were at intervals shaded with gnarled and scrubby oaks.
In approaching one of these clumps of trees, I remarked a number of dark-colored
birds, which afterwards were found to belong to this species, darting
upwards from the topmost branches, and after diving and pitching about in
the air for a moment, returning again to the dead branches with the lively
port that proved them to be engaged in the agreeable pastime of taking their
insect prey. A nearer approach showed them to be light and graceful on
the wing; but less swift and decided in their motions than most of the true
Fly-catchers. There were about a dozen in company, and they presented a
pleasing sight, as three or four together were constantly either pitching
upwards to a considerable height in the air, or gliding silently back to their
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
perches. In these &aelig;rial evolutions, the bright spot on the wing, which is
formed by broad patches of white on the inner webs of six or seven of the
quill feathers, and is visible only when the wing is spread, gleamed conspicuously
in the sunshine, and formed a fine contrast with the glossy black
of the general plumage. I sat upon my horse, watching their movements
for some time, and I now perceived that two of their numbers were of a dusky
hue, and without the wing spot to which I have referred; but I could discover
no difference in their manners or their style of flight. I, therefore, had little
doubt of their being adult females; for although at that period of the year,
(June 20) the young birds might have been well grown, yet there is generally
a want of decided character in the unpractised flight of young birds, which
betrays them to the Sportsman&rsquo;s eye. In fact, these birds agreed with
Swainson&rsquo;s description of the female in general terms; and my only regret
is that I was not able to satisfy myself by dissection whether these to which
I now refer were in reality adult females, or young males in their first
plumage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, on my attempting to approach still nearer, these birds became
alarmed, and winging their way to the hill-side, alighted on the scraggy
bushes scattered among large projecting rocks, where they resumed their
sport, rising lightly into the air and darting about after insects, which
seemed to be abundant. I followed&mdash;but they were now on the <i>qui vive</i>, and,
without permitting me to get within gun-shot, flew from bush to bush, as I
advanced, keeping all the while in a loose irregular flock, and still pursuing
their sport of fly-catching. In this way they continued to ascend the hills,
until the broken character of the ground abruptly stopped my horse. Having,
however, dismounted, I clambered over the rocks, and at last succeeded in
killing two of them. These were alike in plumage&mdash;black, with the wing
spot; and one of them, which I dissected, proved to be a male.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I journeyed on towards the Sierra Nevada, I met, during several
days succeeding, these birds, either in small companies, or singly; and subsequently
I found a few individuals between <i>El Chino</i> and <i>Los Angeles</i>; but
they were invariably black, with the white wing spot. And I never on any
occasion, except the one I have referred to, saw one of those clad in dusky
garments, which I had supposed were females.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The localities in which I found these birds, were either on the mountainsides,
or in the timbered borders of mountain streams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The measurements of the fresh specimen were as follows&mdash;length,
8 inches; wing, 3&frac12;; tail, 3&frac12;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The figure slender&mdash;the feet rather strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This bird has also been noticed by Dr. Heermann, in various parts of California,
and by Dr. Henry, and Dr. Kennerly, in New Mexico. To the
former gentleman, we are indebted for the following contribution, intended
for our present article:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;This bird is seldom found in the northern part of California, though I
procured both adults and young on the Consumnes river, in 1851. Since
then, however, a naturalist and friend of mine residing there has not seen a
single other specimen, though giving much of his attention to ornithology,
and to the migratory habits of such birds as pass through that section of
country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was therefore surprised to meet with this species after sixty miles of
travel on the Colorado desert near the Little Lagoon. It was perched on a
<i>Mesquite</i> tree, jerking its tail almost incessantly, as do various other species
of Fly-catchers, and dashing occasionally in irregular curves and angles high
into the air in pursuit of insects. On approaching the Colorado, this Fly-catcher
became quite abundant, as I frequently saw companies of twenty or
thirty together, many of which would be on the wing at the same time,
engaged at their usual employment. At Fort Yuma, this species was also
met with in considerable numbers late in November, when they were migrating
southward. Its note is a low, plaintive whistle. This bird undoubtedly
incubates in California, as I have seen specimens which were certainly very
young birds, though I have not been so fortunate as to discover its nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Near Fort Webster, in New Mexico, Dr. Henry has seen this bird, though
he considers it of rather rare occurrence. Dr. Kennerly noticed it in abundance
during the months of February and March, on the route of Lieut.
Whipple&rsquo;s party, from the Big Sandy creek to the Great Colorado river.</p>
<p>Our plate represents the adult male and female about two-thirds of the
size of life.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Obs.</span> A remarkable resemblance exists between the bird now before us
and two other species of Fly-catchers of another genus, <i>Fluvicola comata</i>
(Licht.), and <i>Fluvicola nigerrima</i> (Vieill), both of which are natives of South
America, and we have seen the latter also from Mexico. The three birds
resemble each other in general form in a very considerable degree, and in
colors are almost absolutely the same, the prevalent black of the plumage
differing only in shade. Generic and specific distinctions can, however,
readily be made out on comparison of specimens. <i>Fluvicola</i> has the bill
longer and not so wide at the base and with much stronger bristles; the
wings are differently constructed, the first primary being long and well
developed, not short or rudimentary as in <i>Ptilogonys</i>. In those two species
of <i>Fluvicola</i>, which differ from each other materially only in size, the white
spot is more at the base of the wing feathers than in <i>Ptilogonys nitens</i>, in
which it occupies the middle third of the primaries. <i>Fluvicola comata</i> is the
same as <i>Blechropus cristatus</i>, Swainson, in Naturalist&rsquo;s Library, Flycatchers,
p. 99, plate 7. No other species of <i>Ptilogonys</i> is black.</p>

<br />The White-throated Wren.
<br />PLATE XXX.&mdash;Adult Male.</h2>
<p>In the United States, the little House Wren is associated with so many
pleasing recollections, and possesses such pre-eminently social and familiar
habits, that one almost expects in all birds bearing the name of wrens, to find
similarity of disposition, and perhaps similar regard from the people of other
lands. But this is by no means the case. There is really but one House
Wren, and that is the little fellow who comes punctually in the early spring,
and evidently without a doubt of his being welcome to take possession of the
box or other habitation of the previous season, perhaps of many seasons.
And forthwith he commences housekeeping, which usually, if no accidental
discouragements intervene, is very successful, as one may judge from the
number of little heads soon to be seen by peeping in at the door of his
domicile.</p>
<p>The Wren is, in this country, nearly as much of a household bird as the
Robin, of Europe, and more than any other, not even excepting the Martin,
is universally regarded with favor. He is, however, the only one of the
numerous species of American Wrens that shows any disposition to cultivate
the acquaintance of mankind, or at all to accept of any proffered hospitalities.
Though the Carolina Wren and Bewick&rsquo;s Wren both venture occasionally
into the garden or orchard, they are comparatively shy and apprehensive,
apparently, of there being danger in too great familiarity.</p>
<p>The large species represented in our present plate is a native of Mexico
and California, and lives exclusively in localities remote from the habitations
of man. Though known as a bird of Mexico, it is not represented as an
abundant species in that country, and within the limits of the United States
has been observed only by Dr. Heermann, and Dr. Kennerly.</p>
<p>In his notes on the Birds of California, in the Journal of the Philadelphia
Academy, II. p. 263, Dr. Heermann&rsquo;s observations on the present bird are
as follows, and contain the first notice of this species as an inhabitant of the
United States:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I first met with this bird in the fall of 1851, on the Consumnes river,
but in the spring of 1852, I procured three specimens on the Calaveras river.
It is an active bird, having a loud sprightly song, that is heard at a considerable
distance, and which it repeats at short intervals. I found it occupied
in searching for insects between and under the large boulders of rock which,
along some portions of this river, are thrown together in confused masses, as
if by some terrific convulsion of nature.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Dr. Kennerly, during the survey recently completed by Lieut. Whipple&rsquo;s
party, noticed this Wren in New Mexico, and obtained specimens now deposited
in the National Museum at Washington city. For our present article he has
very kindly favored us with the following note:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This active little bird was observed only among the hills along the head
waters of Bill Williams&rsquo; fork. In the most rugged and inaccessible places it
was generally found busily engaged in searching for food, rapidly passing
around and among the rocks with great activity, and accompanying its movements
with its short and peculiar chirp. It is so constantly in motion that
specimens can only be obtained with difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This species was described by Mr. Swainson, from specimens sent to
Europe from Real del Monte, in Mexico, and we have seen others from
various parts of that country.</p>
<p>The figure in the plate now before the reader, is that of an adult male,
and is about two-thirds of the size of life.</p>
<p>The plant represented is <i>Nemophila insignis</i>, a native of California.</p>

<p>General form short and heavy, with the head apparently disproportionately
large, and frequently furnished with ear-like tufts of feathers. Cavity
of the ear, large; eyes, usually large, directed forwards, and in the greater
number of species formed for seeing by twilight or in the night; bill, nearly
concealed by projecting bristle-like feathers; wings, usually, rather long and
formed for rather slow and noiseless flight, outer edges of primary quills
fringed; tail, various, usually short; legs, generally, rather short, and in all
the species, except those of the Asiatic genus <i>Ketupa</i>, Lesson, more or less
feathered to the toes, generally densely; face surrounded by a more or less
perfect disc or circle of short rigid feathers, which circle, with the large
eyes directed forwards, gives to these birds an entirely peculiar and cat-like
expression, indicative of their analogy to the <i>Feline</i> quadrupeds.</p>
<p>Female larger than the male. General organization adapted to the destruction
of living animals in the night, or in the morning and evening
twilight&mdash;midnight appears to be the noon of these birds, at which they are
not disposed to activity.</p>
<p>Species of owls inhabit all parts of the world, most abundantly in America
and Asia. There are about one hundred and forty described species, of which
number, specimens of about one hundred and twenty are in the collection
of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. The species inhabiting
the continent and islands of America are about forty.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Obs.</span> This handsome species of Owl may be regarded as most properly a
southern and western species, being of rather rare occurrence north of Virginia,
though it breeds occasionally in the Northern States. It is nearly
related to <i>Strix flammea</i> of Europe, but is larger. It very much resembles
also several other species of various parts of the world, such as <i>S. perlata</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
of South America, <i>S. furcata</i> of the island of Cuba, and others. Naturalists
have, in fact, established species on very slender characters, amongst the
owls of this group. It is a very harmless bird, resorting in the south to
buildings and outhouses, and subsisting on small animals. Different specimens
vary considerably in shade of color and somewhat in dimensions.</p>

webs with dark fulvous, a black spot above and extending somewhat in front of the eye,
radiating feathers behind the eye, dark reddish fulvous, feathers of the facial disc tipped
with black; throat and neck before, white; breast, with wide longitudinal stripes of black;
other under parts finely variegated with white and fulvous, and every feather having
transverse narrow lines of dark-brown. In many specimens, the middle of the abdomen
is pure white; legs and toes light fulvous, generally unspotted, but in some specimens,
with transverse narrow bars of dark-brown; quills, brown, with wide transverse bands

<p>The colors of the plumage, and the size also, in this species, vary materially.
There may be distinguished the following varieties, which appear to be
permanent in individual specimens, and are to some extent geographical.
Though at present, with a large number of specimens before us, we are of
opinion that they are all of one species, it may be that they are distinct:</p>

<p>The common species as just described. Feathers of the face behind the eye, always
bright reddish fulvous, and the entire plumage more marked with that color than in the
others, as below. This variety inhabits the eastern and northern portion of North
America.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Obs.</span> This is one of the most abundant of the Owls inhabiting the States
on the Atlantic seaboard. It presents two constant varieties of plumage,
which have been regarded as distinct species; the mottled or gray described
above as the adult, and the red described as younger. These two varieties
appear to be very similar to those of the European <i>Syrnium aluco</i>, and to
some other species.</p>
<p>The Rev. Dr. Bachman, of Charleston, S. C., has fully established the
identity of the two, and we have fully confirmed the accuracy of his observations
(in Aud. Orn. Biog., V. p. 392). The young birds, as stated by him,
are red when fully feathered, or nearly so; but we have observed that previously
they are transversely striped with brown and white, with but little
tinge of red, and presenting a general appearance somewhat like the adult
mottled bird. They pair and breed in the red plumage, and it is not unusual
to find a mottled male and red female associated, or the reverse. According to
Dr. Bachman, the perfect plumage is assumed at the age of two years. Intermediate
specimens, impossible to be referred absolutely to either of the
plumages, are not uncommon.</p>
<p>This bird holds its place throughout the country in spite of the constant
destruction of the woodlands; and though universally known and scarcely
regarded favorably by our people, is seldom molested. Its food is principally
insects.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Obs.</span> This Owl is of frequent occurrence, especially in the winter season,
throughout the Eastern States of the Union, and appears to prefer meadows
and marshes along the course of rivers or other streams of water. We have
met with it, too, occasionally in straggling bushes in fields remote from such
localities.</p>
<p>This bird has been almost universally considered identical with the bird
known by the same name, which is found throughout Europe and Asia; but
it is nearly or quite as distinct as some other American birds of this family
recognised on all hands as separate species. On comparison of series of specimens
of the two, it will be found that the American are larger, and for
much the greater part darker colored, especially the females. The name
<i>brachyotus</i> is, however, applicable to the American species only, having been
first applied by Forster to an American specimen in his &ldquo;Account of the
Birds sent from Hudson&rsquo;s Bay, with observations relative to their Natural
History,&rdquo; in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, London,
1772.</p>
<p>We have had no facilities for comparing the stages of plumage of the young
of the American and European or Asiatic species, but have no doubt they
will be found to present sufficient distinctive characters. We have omitted
the many synonymes of the European bird, for reasons above intimated.</p>
<p><i>Otus galapagoensis</i>, Gould, is scarcely to be distinguished from our present
bird. Admitting the genus <i>Brachyotus</i>, Gould, we think it very probable
that the name of the present species ought to stand <i>Brachyotus galapagoensis</i>
(Gould).</p>
<p>Very fine specimens of this Owl are contained in the large and highly
interesting collection of birds made in Chili, by Lieut. Gilliss, of the United
States Navy. It appears to inhabit the plains on the Pacific, and nearly all
the specimens are of a deeper shade of fulvous than is usually met with in
those of the North, though we have seen specimens of the latter precisely
similar to them.</p>

the woods, that showed no signs of alarm whatever on being approached, and
apparently not at all familiar with man nor with the sound of the gun.
During some winters it is abundant in Pennsylvania, probably having
migrated from farther north. When wounded, this species seeks safety by
hopping away quite awkwardly, showing nothing of the courage of the Great
Horned Owl, or even of the comparatively small long-cared species (<i>Otus
Wilsonianus</i>), both of which will stand up manfully and defend themselves
to the best of their ability, while life lasts.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Obs.</span> Within the limits of the United States, this handsome little Owl
has, as yet, only been observed by Dr. Hoy, whose specimens were obtained
at Racine, Wisconsin. It is alluded to as <i>Strix acadica</i>, and accurately
described by Dr. Hall in his MSS. &ldquo;Sketch of the Zoology of the district
of Montreal,&rdquo; though represented as of rare occurrence. It is probably a
northern and northwestern species.</p>
<p>In the paper cited above, Prof. Lichtenstein regards this bird as the adult
<i>Nyctale acadica</i>, and this appears to be the opinion also of the Prince of
Canino (Cons. Av., p. 54). It is about the size of <i>N. acadica</i>, but of the
numerous specimens of that species which have come under our notice, not
one has presented intermediate characters, or has otherwise excited a suspicion
that the two species were identical. We at present consider them as
distinct species.</p>

particularly of Canada. The supposed female is destitute of the white forehead, which

<p>The same species, and probably the same specimen, is described by
Latham, in General Synopsis of Birds, Supplement II. p. 58 (1801).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;White-fronted Owl, <i>Nat. Mis.</i>, pl. 171. Size of the <i>Little Owl</i>. Length eight inches;
general color of the plumage on the upper parts brown; the circle of the feathers round
the eyes dark, fringed at the back part with white; between the eyes and over the bill
and the chin white; the under parts from thence yellow buff; across the breast a pale
brown band; on the wing-coverts a spot or two of white; the first five quills marked with
a white spot on the outer, and the second quills with the same on the inner margins; the
first quills serrated on the outer edge the whole length; the second quill the same, half-way

<p>&ldquo;This was brought from Quebec, by General Davies, in 1790, and with it another much
smaller, which he had in his possession alive; it differed in being more dusky, and the
circles of the face not fringed on the back part; otherwise so like, as to be supposed
merely differing in age or sex. The General observed to me that this bird frequently
erected two feathers over the eye; but although I inspected the specimens very narrowly,

<p><span class="sc">Obs.</span> This curious Owl is very abundant in some localities in Western
America, where it lives in communities in burrows in the ground. It is
nearly related to several South American species, especially to <i>Athene cunicularia</i>,
which is a native of the western countries of that portion of this
continent.</p>
<p>We have doubts that fig. 1 of Mr. Audubon&rsquo;s plate 432 represents this
bird, but think it probable that it represents one of the South American
species, which fig. 2 of the same plate clearly does. Dr. Townsend&rsquo;s collection,
specimens from which were figured by Mr. Audubon, contained birds
of Chili and Peru, as well as of North America, from which circumstance the
error may have occurred.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Obs.</span> This minute species of Owl is exclusively Western, having as yet
only been noticed in California. It much resembles the European <i>Glaucidium
passerinum</i>, and is about the same size. The most readily detected
differences are the nearly naked toes of the present bird, and the absence of
the decided reddish tinge which prevails in the color of the European species.
It also resembles <i>G. passerinoides</i> of South America, but differs also from
that species in color and other particulars.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Obs.</span> This large and handsome Owl is abundant in the Arctic regions of
America, and has been observed at the highest northern latitude yet reached
by voyagers. In the winter, it migrates southward over the greater part of
Asia, Europe, and North America. It is to be met with every winter in the
Northern and Middle States of the Union, though greatly varying in numbers
in different years. We have known it to be so abundant in Pennsylvania and
New Jersey, as to be brought commonly by the farmers to the market in
Philadelphia, and sold for a trifle.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p><span class="sc">Obs.</span> This remarkable species, which partakes of the characters of both
an Owl and a Hawk, is of very rare occurrence in the Middle States of this
Union, though abundant in the northern regions of America, and occasionally
met with in the Northern States. It is in a great measure diurnal in its
habits, venturing abroad boldly in daylight.</p>
<p>Careful examination of numerous American and European specimens has
not enabled us to detect any differences.</p>
<p>This bird was undoubtedly meant by Linn&aelig;us in his description of <i>Strix
ulula</i>. The name applied to it by various authors, <i>Strix funerea</i>, is properly
applicable to the European species, to which Gmelin gave the name
<i>Strix Tengmalmi</i>.</p>
<p>The descriptions now given embrace all the species of Owls the existence
of which in America north of Mexico is satisfactorily demonstrated; though
in the succeeding pages various others will be enumerated as obscure or little
known.</p>
<p>All the species enumerated in the preceding synopsis, except <i>Nyctale
albifrons</i>, are known to be of common occurrence in some part of that portion
of this continent included in our limits; and specimens of a majority of them
can be obtained generally in the course of a single winter in the markets of
either of the larger cities, being brought for sale from the country, as is the
case with the Falcons, and also all the larger and most common wading and
swimming birds. The study of the habits of Owls is, however, attended with
peculiar difficulties, on account of their nocturnal habits; and it is not therefore
remarkable that questions respecting common species are yet to be
regarded as unsettled. The identity, for instance, of <i>Scops asio</i> and <i>Scops
n&aelig;via</i>, is by no means universally admitted; nor, if identical, is the change
in the colors of their plumage sufficiently well understood. Gentlemen well
acquainted with American ornithology, and in whose opinions we have the
highest confidence (as, for instance, Thomas B. Wilson, M. D., and Samuel
W. Woodhouse, M. D., of Philadelphia), are strongly disposed to doubt that
they are identical.</p>
<p>Specimens of Owls to be met with in North American collections are very
generally in winter plumage; and the procuring of several of the species in
the spring or during the summer, is comparatively of unusual occurrence.
The fully ascertaining of the seasonal changes in any species is yet desirable,
even if only confirming previously known facts, or the statements of authors.
It is possible that <i>Nyctale albifrons</i> is the adult of <i>Nyctale acadica</i>. This
we give as an example illustrative of the importance of further observations,
and may be allowed to add that, of several American species nearly related
to others of Europe and Asia, the comparison of specimens of similar ages
and in similar seasonal plumage, is only satisfactory and reliable.</p>
<p>In Western North America, it is exceedingly probable that species of this
family exist which are yet unknown to naturalists. In Texas, species known
as inhabitants of Mexico may yet be detected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>All the Owls found in the northern portion of the United States, are in
some measure migratory, and some species appear to travel in large bands,
scattered over a considerable extent of country. The Snowy Owl is sometimes
abundant for a few days, and then will suddenly disappear from a
district, perhaps soon to appear again. The Marsh Owl appears along the
river Delaware occasionally in considerable numbers, and staying but a short
time, or leaving apparently only a few stragglers. We once saw what was
very nearly a flock of this species, on a shooting excursion in &ldquo;the Neck,&rdquo;
as it is called, or the point of land below Philadelphia, formed by the
junction of the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, the larger portion of which is
wholly devoted to the cultivation of culinary vegetables for the market of the
city. On getting over the fence into a small field, in which a crop of cabbages
had been raised, the smaller <i>heads</i> of many of which remained, we
were surprised to see a large number of stalks ornamentally surmounted by
Owls. They soon, however, dispersed in all directions.</p>
<p>The Barn Owl (<i>Strix pratincola</i>), as well as the Marsh Owl (<i>Otus brachyotus</i>),
we have known to occur in open fields, where but little concealment was
possible.</p>
<p>The Red or Mottled Owl is very persistent in its locality, and the same
pair probably returns to the woods that it has previously occupied in preceding
seasons, in some measure disregarding encroachments on its extent. In
a small tract of timbered land at Powelton, the hospitable residence of John
Hare Powel, Esq., surrounded by villages constituting a portion of the
suburbs of Philadelphia, a pair of this species continued to appear and to
raise broods of young until within a period of only two or three years past,
notwithstanding constantly occurring chances of molestation.</p>
<p>An interesting fact relating to the species just mentioned (<i>Scops asio</i>), has
recently been communicated to us by our esteemed friend, Mr. William Kite,
of Chester county, Pennsylvania, a careful observer, much attached to the
pursuit of natural history. He made the singular discovery that in this
species the early ceremonies in the association of a pair about to assume the
duties of incubation were for the greater part performed on the ground, and
were accompanied invariably by unusual and continued cries, thus illustrating
in a striking manner the strong analogy of these birds to the cat-like quadrupeds.
This remarkable circumstance we regard as new in the history of
this family of birds, and the observation of other species would be in a high
degree interesting.</p>
<p>Further investigations and collections in this family are particularly
desirable in the western and northwestern regions of North America, and
will very probably result in the discovery of species not now known to
naturalists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Spotted Owl (<i>Wapacuthu</i>) weighs five pounds, and is two feet long and four
broad; the irides bright yellow; bill and talons shining black, and much curved, the
former covered with bristly hairs projecting from the base; space between the eyes, the
cheeks, and throat, white; on the top of the head, and on each side of the concha, the
extreme parts of the feathers are dusky black; concha dirty white; scapularies, with the
lesser and greater coverts of the wings, white, elegantly barred with reddish dusky spots
pointing downwards; the quill feathers and tail are irregularly barred and spotted with
pale red and black; back and coverts of the tail white, with a few dusky spots; under
coverts and vent feathers white; the breast and belly dusky white, crossed with an
infinite number of narrow reddish bars; the legs are feathered to the toes; the latter
covered with hairs like those of the bill, but not so strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bird is an inhabitant of the woods, makes a nest in the moss on dry ground,
lays from <i>five to ten</i> white eggs in May, and the young fly in June, and are entirely white
for some time after. They feed on mice and small birds, which they generally kill themselves.
Hutchins&rsquo; MSS., p. 99.&rdquo; Fauna. Bor. Am., Birds, p. 99.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This species, if distinct from the Snowy Owl, is absolutely unknown to
naturalists, never having been noticed by any traveller since Mr. Hutchins.
Though, from the description above quoted, apparently a peculiar species,
the same name is given by the natives in the vicinity of Hudson&rsquo;s Bay, to
the Snowy Owl, according to Mr. Hearne (Journey to the Northern Ocean,
p. 402. London, 1795, quarto); and it, too, makes its nest on the ground.
With so little positive information, it is impossible to form more than conjectures
respecting the bird alluded to in the description, and it must be left as
an interesting matter of inquiry for future explorers and naturalists.</p>
<p>It may be observed with reference to Mr. Hearne&rsquo;s statement, that if the
bird he alluded to was really an Owl, it differs from any other American
species in laying from &ldquo;five to ten eggs.&rdquo; Careful and evidently accurate
statements respecting the incubation of nearly all the northern species, are
given by Dr. Hall, in his &ldquo;Sketch of the Zoology of the District of Montreal&rdquo;
(manuscript in our possession); and no species is represented as producing
more than &ldquo;four to five eggs,&rdquo; except the Mottled Owl (<i>Scops
n&aelig;via</i>), which lays &ldquo;five to six.&rdquo; The Snowy Owl, it is stated by Dr. Hall,
lays &ldquo;two white eggs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This bird is placed by Latham, in his division of Owls, &ldquo;with smooth

description is not, however, entirely applicable. This name may, however,
be entitled to precedence as the proper name of that species in the genus
<i>Brachyotus</i>; and, as an aspirant to such honors, we recommend it to the
favorable notice of enterprising ornithologists; and also, while our hand is
in, respectfully suggest that as a name for the allied European species, <i>arctica</i>,
Sparrmann, which dates 1789 (Mus. Carls., pl. 51), might do as well as

<p>Stated by Professor Barton to have been observed by him in Pennsylvania
on the 15th of December, 1791, but of the species he gives no description.</p>
<p>The names and descriptions now given comprise all that have come under
our notice, represented as inhabiting North America within our limits.</p>
<p>Of the birds of this family, the names proposed by the older American
naturalists and others, are not numerous; and though the group may be
regarded as presenting some difficulties to the student, the correct nomenclature
of North American species is not difficult to determine. Bartram enumerated
six species (Travels, p. 285), to all of which, except one, he gives
names for the first time employed to designate the birds to which he alludes,
and to a few of which he attaches sufficient descriptions. All of his species
had, however, been previously described, and we have, we believe, cited his
names as synonymes, so far as they can be ascertained.</p>
<p>The greatest difficulty in the study of the Owls of North America will be
found in the intimate resemblance that a few species bear to others of Europe
and Asia, and, we may add, in the examination of the birds which we have
given in the preceding pages as varieties of the Great-horned Owl (<i>Bubo
virginianus</i>). The variations that we have noticed, and especially those of
color, may be ascertained by subsequent observation to be so uniform and
constant as to constitute specific distinction, though at present we cannot so
regard them.</p>
<p>In the Owls of other countries there are several groups in which it is very
difficult to determine the species, on account of their resemblance to each
other. This is especially the case with the small species of the genus <i>Scops</i>,
which inhabit India and other countries of Asia; and there are, too, many
of the birds of this genus, of all countries, that are exceedingly perplexing.
In fact, we would hardly recommend a student in natural history to begin
General Ornithology with the Owls.</p>
<p>With this family we conclude the rapacious Birds.</p>

<br />PLATE XXXI.&mdash;Adult Male and Young Female.</h2>
<p>One of the most remarkable facts in the geographical distribution of the
birds of western and northwestern North America is, that many species
extend their range in northern latitudes almost or quite to the shores of the
Atlantic ocean, while not a single instance is on record of the same species
having been observed in either of the middle or southern States of the Union.
The Magpie, which on the Pacific is commonly found southwardly as far as
Mexico, has been noticed by Dr. Hoy, at Racine, in the State of Wisconsin.
The Lark Bunting (<i>Emberiza grammaca</i>), another western bird, has also
been ascertained by the same gentleman to be abundant in the State just
mentioned; and the only specimen that we have ever seen of the Stone Chat
of America (<i>Saxicola &oelig;nanthoides</i>), a bird discovered some years since on
the coast of Oregon, was obtained in the vicinity of Halifax, Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Many instances tending to demonstrate this extensive and remarkable
migration might be produced, but we have unfortunately to acknowledge
ourselves unable to offer a theory or even hypothesis attempting to account
for it, and must regard the facts as remaining among many in natural history
with which naturalists are for the present under the necessity of resting,
without inference or application to any established general principles. Important
results will yet reward American naturalists who may engage in this
interesting field of scientific research.</p>
<p>Instinct is little or nothing more than inherited memory. But we are by
no means satisfied that any definition which we have yet met with of the
faculty known by the latter name is strictly correct. Whatever memory is,
that inherited we are disposed to regard as instinct. And that the impressions
on this faculty are transmissable in animals from parents to their offspring,
we regard the migration of young birds, particularly those of a first
brood, when the parents remain to attend to a second, as clearly substantiating.</p>
<p>The bird now before the reader is a species that appears to perform the
extended northward migration to which we have alluded, and is one of the
most remarkable instances that has come to our knowledge. It was first
described by us from a specimen obtained in the vicinity of Montreal, Canada,
and the only instance of its having been observed since, has been by Dr.
Heermann, in California; though if ever occurring in the middle or southern
States on the Atlantic, in the same latitude as on the Pacific, it has escaped
the researches of all previous naturalists or travellers.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>Adult and young birds of this species were observed, and specimens were
obtained by Dr. Heermann, who ascertained that it reared its young in
California.</p>
<p>For an opportunity to examine the specimen originally described by us in
the present volume (<a href="#Page_102">p. 102</a>), we are indebted to our lamented friend and correspondent,
M. McCulloch, M. D., a naturalist of extensive acquirements,
and an eminent physician, late of Montreal, but, we much regret to add, now
recently deceased, and to John Pangman, Esq., of Grace Hall, in the vicinity
of that city. Mr. Pangman had the kindness to interest himself, in conjunction
with Dr. McCulloch, so much as to obtain the loan of the specimen from
the Natural History Society of Montreal, in the museum of which it was
deposited, and to bring it for our inspection to Philadelphia, and we shall not
soon forget his evident and enlightened gratification, nor our own great
pleasure, when we assured him that it was a bird hitherto unknown as an
inhabitant of North America, and, as we then supposed, very probably an
undescribed species, which we subsequently ascertained to be the case.</p>
<p>This is one of the most remarkable of the rapacious birds which have been
recently added to the ornithological fauna of the United States. It differs
entirely in color from any previously-known American species, unless it may
be supposed to approximate in that character to the little-known Harlan&rsquo;s
Buzzard of Audubon. It bears also some distant resemblance to one stage
of plumage of the Black Hawk.</p>
<p>The only information relative to the habits of this bird that we have in
our power at present to lay before the reader, is the following from the
Journal of Dr. Heermann:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I first remarked this species at the crossing of Graysonville ferry, on the
San Joaquim river, California, and continued to meet with it occasionally until
we had crossed Kern river. Owing to the lateness of the season, I was able
to ascertain but little respecting its propagation; the only nests which were
found having been forsaken some time previously by the young. These nests,
composed externally of coarse sticks, and lined with roots, were built in the
topmost branches of oaks, which grow abundantly on the banks of the large
water-courses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bird, like the rest of its genus, appears sluggish in its habits, perching
for hours in a quiescent state on some tall tree, and permitting the hunter
to approach without showing any signs of fear. This apparent stolidity may,
however, be owing to the fact that it is seldom molested, and has not yet
learned to mistrust a gun, as do the birds of prey in more settled portions of
the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The specimens brought by Dr. Heermann are now in the national collection
at Washington city.</p>

<br />The Black-breasted Woodpecker.
<br />PLATE XXXII.&mdash;Male.</h2>
<p>The species of Woodpeckers are more abundant in the regions on the
Pacific Ocean or west of the Rocky mountains than in any other part of North
America. Several of them inhabiting those countries are, too, amongst the
handsomest birds of this family, as, for instance, Lewis&rsquo;s Woodpecker (<i>Melanerpes
torquatus</i>), a species now brought in almost every collection from
California; the Red-breasted Woodpecker (<i>Melanerpes ruber</i>), a beautiful
little species, with the head, neck and breast brilliant carmine; the Californian
Woodpecker (<i>Melanerpes formicivorus</i>), figured in plate 2 of the present
volume; and various others, attractive on account of either the beauty or the
singularity of their colors.</p>
<p>The extensive and but partially-explored forests of Northern California and
Oregon are peculiarly well adapted to the habits of this group of birds. This
is, however, not solely the reason that they are found there; but there are
principles involved which are at present beyond the deepest reasoning of
zoologists, and are as yet subjects of theory only. All that we can positively
advance is, that of the Woodpeckers of North America, the greatest number
of species, and of more handsome plumaged forms, than elsewhere in our
portion of the continent, are inhabitants of California and Oregon; and that
whatever causes have tended to the development of this family of birds, they
have been more efficient in the regions alluded to, than elsewhere in North
America.</p>
<p>Philosophic zoology is yet in its infancy. Extreme conservatism in science
fondly rests satisfied with present knowledge, and visionary speculators raise
mountains of opinionative systems and theories, which must be cleared away
to allow real progress. Between the two classes of operators, the true man
of science may have a difficult time of it. Of sawing the air there is abundance,
but much as elsewhere very little is done in zoology with due emphasis
and discretion.</p>
<p>In addition to the species alluded to above, there is found in the forests of
Oregon and the Rocky Mountains, the largest of all the Woodpeckers, a magnificent
species related to the Ivory-billed Woodpecker of the Southern States, but
much larger, and which has up to this period escaped the observation of any
American naturalist, except Dr. Townsend, who saw it, but did not procure
specimens. It is the <i>Dryocopus imperialis</i>, first described by Mr. Gould, a
distinguished English ornithologist. This fine bird will be figured in a subsequent
part of the present volume.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>The bird now before the reader was discovered in California by Mr. John
G. Bell, of New York, deservedly well known as a naturalist, and beyond
comparison the most skilful preparer of birds and quadrupeds and general
taxidermist in the United States. Mr. Bell was the first naturalist who
visited California after it became a portion of the United States; and during
his stay in that country, made a large and highly interesting collection, in
which was the present and other new species. He observes in his notes now
before us, that he found this bird in one locality only, and observed but two
specimens, both of which he obtained.</p>
<p>Subsequently this Woodpecker has been found in California by Dr. Heermann,
and in New Mexico by Dr. Henry; but is stated by both to be of rare
occurrence. The former of these gentlemen observes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I procured this bird three years since in the southern mines of California,
where it frequents more especially the pine trees. I never saw it alight on
the oaks, although abundant in that locality. It is one of the most rare of
the Woodpeckers of that country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Henry states: &ldquo;Of this bird I know nothing farther than that I procured
a single specimen in the mountains near Fort Webster, in the winter
of 1852-3. I shot it from near the summit of a tall pine tree, and was not
aware until I obtained it, that it was different from any other species that I
had ever seen. My efforts to find it again have been unremitting, but without
success; and I regard it as a rare bird in this district. The specimen in
my collection is an adult male.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The figure in our plate is two-thirds of the size of life.</p>

in colors, it shows an alliance to that group of typical <i>Picus</i>, which

<br />The Texan Cardinal Bird.
<br />PLATE XXXIII. Male and Female.</h2>
<p>In our present plate we present to the reader one of the most delicately
colored of the many fine-plumaged birds which inhabit the southwestern countries
of this Republic, and it is another of the birds of Mexico whose range of
locality northwardly extends to within the limits of the United States. Our bird
is, however, resident in Texas, or of but limited migration during the coldest
season. It has occasionally been observed in considerable numbers; but is
as yet to be met with in comparatively few collections, and is much valued
by collectors.</p>
<p>Though not very closely resembling the beautiful Cardinal bird of the
Northern States (<i>Cardinalis virginianus</i>), its general form, particularly its
lengthened and handsome crest and long tail, are strictly similar, and its
habits are of the same general character. The bill, however, in the present
species will be found to be singularly different from that of any other bird
of this genus.</p>
<p>The group of birds to which that now before us belongs, is composed of
four or five species remarkable for their graceful forms and very showy colors,
all of which inhabit North and Central America. In addition to the attractions
of their plumage, these birds possess very considerable powers of voice,
though by no means entitled to be ranked as songsters. The Cardinal bird,
known also by the names of Virginia Nightingale and Red Bird, is the only
species inhabiting the States north of Texas, and is frequently met with at
all seasons in the States on the Atlantic. It inhabits, for the greater part,
low and damp woods, in which there is a profuse undergrowth of bushes, and
is particularly partial to the vicinity of water-courses. The male, on account
of the splendid vermilion of his plumage, always attracts attention; and
though rather shy and careful in exposing himself, is frequently shot by
gunners for no other purpose than the possession of such a handsome bird.</p>
<p>The colors of our northern Cardinal bird are vermilion, with the throat
black. In Mexico, there is found another beautiful species, singularly
resembling in form and color that to which we have just alluded, but wanting
the black throat. It differs also in the shape of the bill and some minor
characters.</p>
<p>The bird now before the reader was originally described as a bird of
Mexico, in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, by Charles
Lucian Bonaparte, Prince of Canino, one of the most accomplished zoologists
of Europe, and held in deservedly high estimation in this country, on account
of his splendid volumes on American Ornithology. His specimens were
obtained near the city of Mexico.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>Within the limits of the United States, this species was first observed by Capt.
J. P. McCown, of the United States Army, at Ringgold Barracks, in Texas.
Since that period, it has been noticed and specimens brought in collections
by several of the naturalists, who have accompanied expeditions sent by the
government, though never, so far as we have learned, out of the State of
Texas.</p>
<p>To Captain McCown we are indebted for the following note respecting
this species, for which and many similar favors we beg to tender our
acknowledgements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This handsome species was occasionally seen on the Rio Grande, having
apparently a strong partiality for damp and bushy woods; and in fact so far
as I observed never venturing far from the river. I cannot speak positively,
but am under the impression that it remains in Texas during the whole year,
having seen it so late in the fall, and again so early in the Spring, that if not
constantly resident, its migration must at any rate be very limited. It is a
gay, sprightly bird, generally seen in company with others of the same
species, frequently erecting its crest, and calling to its mate or comrades,
though rather shy and not easily approached. Its voice and general habits
appeared to me as very similar to those of the common species of the Northern
States. I never saw its nest, though it undoubtedly breeds in Texas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During his late connection with Lieut. Williamson&rsquo;s expedition, this bird
was noticed by Dr. Heermann, from whose beautiful specimens, through his
kindness, our plate has been prepared, and who has allowed us to make the
following extract from his Journal:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After leaving Teusoa, we observed the first specimen of this bird but
little beyond the crossing of the San Pedro river. It was in a dry caignau,
perched on a bush, and seemed weary and lost, and was probably a wanderer,
as no more were observed until we reached El Paso. At this place, in the
vicinity of the habitations of man, we found it quite common, frequenting the
hedges and trees, and continued to see it occasionally on our road until we
left civilization behind us. Raising its crest erect as it moves actively about
in search of food, it emits at intervals a clear, plaintive whistle, varied by a
few detached notes. It is said to be quite common on the Rio Grande river
and in Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This species was also found in Texas by Mr. John H. Clark, zoologist,
attached to the Mexican boundary surveying party. In Mexico, particularly
in the States of Tamaulipas and Nueva Leon, Lieut. Couch observed it in
considerable numbers.</p>
<p>Our figures, which are those of the adult male and female, are rather less
than two-thirds of the size of life.</p>

<br />The American Stone Chat.
<br />PLATE XXXIV.&mdash;Adult.</h2>
<p>The Stone Chats and Wheat Ears, which are the English names of birds
of the genus <i>Saxicola</i>, are abundant in the old world, though the greater
number of the species appear to be restricted to Africa. The few that are
natives of Europe are numerous throughout the greater part of that continent.
They are birds of plain but agreeable colors, and inhabit fields and other open
grounds or plains covered with shrub-like vegetation, running with facility,
and making their nests on the ground, or in holes beneath the surface. These
are curiously constructed by some species of this group, and very carefully
concealed, though frequently in situations much exposed. There are nearly
forty species of this group of birds composing the present and a nearly allied
genus.</p>
<p>Though there are so many species of these genera, the bird now before us
is the only one that appears to be peculiar to the continent of America. One
other, the <i>Saxicola &oelig;nanthe</i>, a common European bird, is, however, a visitor
to this continent. We have seen undoubted specimens from Greenland, and
occasionally it strays so far southwardly as New York, in the vicinity of
which city a few specimens have been captured, one of which is in the
collection of our friend, Mr. George N. Lawrence.</p>
<p>The present bird was originally described in the Zoology of the Voyage of
the Blossom, from specimens obtained on the western coast of North America;
but apparently the naturalists attached to the party which performed that
voyage, had no opportunities of acquiring any information respecting its
history or the district that it inhabits. Nor have others been more successful;
no American naturalist or traveller having noticed it again in Western
America, notwithstanding the researches which have been carried on in that
portion of this continent.</p>
<p>The only specimen that we have ever seen of this bird is in the collection
of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, to which it was presented
by our intimate and valued friend, Thomas M. Brewer, M. D., of the
city of Boston, one of the most eminent of American ornithologists, and now
particularly devoted to the investigation of the nidification and oology of the
birds of this country, the results of which we hope soon to see published.
Dr. Brewer obtained the specimen alluded to in Nova Scotia, but could
procure no account of it beyond the fact that it was considered as of unusual
occurrence in that province.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>This bird is very closely allied to the Wheat Ear of Europe (<i>S. &oelig;nanthe</i>),
and is in all probability of very similar habits. In the absence of positive
information we can only suppose it to be an inhabitant of the countries north
of the limits of the United States, in which there is a vast extent of territory
well adapted to the habits of birds of this group. It is also probably not an
abundant species, or it would have been noticed more frequently during its
winter migration. But of the ornithology of all the northern portion of the
United States from the ninetieth degree of longitude to the Pacific Ocean, or
west of the Mississippi river, too little is known to justify any conclusions.
Many species of Northern and Western America, of which little or nothing
was previously known, have within a few years been demonstrated to be
abundant, and such may hereafter prove to be the case with the bird which
is the subject of our present article.</p>
<p>The figure in our plate is about two-thirds of the size of life.</p>
<p>The plant represented is <i>Abronia umbellata</i>, a native of western North
America.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Obs.</span> We are not without doubts that the bird now before us is really
distinct from <i>Saxicola &oelig;nanthe</i> of Europe, but having unfortunately a single
specimen only, we cannot make an examination or comparison in all
respects satisfactory. Our specimen is uniformly larger than either of the
numerous specimens of the European species in the collection of the Philadelphia
Academy, and is, as an especial character, longer in the tarsi. Its
measurements do not, however, correspond with those given in the original
description in Voy. Blossom; but it is expressly stated that the specimens
described were in bad condition, and may not be entirely reliable. It is, at
any rate, very closely allied to the European species that we have just
mentioned.</p>
<p>With special reference to the present bird, we shall look with much interest
for the results of future zoological investigations in the northwestern territories
of the United States. There is at the present time no field more inviting
to the American naturalist. While much has been done in California, New
Mexico, and Texas, the extensive regions which we have above designated
have scarcely been entered upon, and will yet contribute much to the fauna
of our country.</p>

<br />The Black-footed Albatross.
<br />PLATE XXXV. Adult Male.</h2>
<p>Those birds whose homes are the sea-coasts and islands, and whose lives
are spent in gleaning a subsistence amongst the billows or by the shores of
the ocean, have always been objects of interest both to the naturalist and the
general observer. Idly reposing on the rocky crag or the sand-bank, or
boldly sweeping the surface of the waters alike in the calm and amidst the
fury of the tempest, few having the opportunity have failed to mark the sea-birds
as a feature in the wild scenery peculiar to the localities for which they
are fitted by nature, and perhaps to associate them with the adventurous
character of our useful fellow-men whose profession it is, in the beautiful
language of the liturgy, to &ldquo;go down upon the deep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The large majority of the many birds that derive their subsistence from
the productions of the Ocean, live habitually on its shores, or venture only
short and easily-regainable distances from the land. This is the case with
the numerous genera comprising the Ducks, Swans, and Geese, as well as the
Pelicans, Cormorants, Penguins, and others. These, for the greater part,
frequent the margins of the bays and estuaries, and many of them are almost
as much birds of the land as of the sea. The Penguins in fact having but
rudiments of wings, and incapable of flight, are necessarily restricted, though
performing very remarkable migrations by swimming. These extraordinary
birds are peculiar to the southern hemisphere, and have been met with amongst
the ice and snow of the highest latitudes which navigators have succeeded in
reaching within the Antarctic circle.</p>
<p>The bird which is the subject of our present article, is one of a group of
species which, possessing great powers of flight and swimming with facility,
do not content themselves with the vicinity of the coast, but venture boldly
out to sea. The largest and best known species, the Wandering Albatross,
has been observed by voyagers at a distance of two thousand miles or upwards
from land; and it is even supposed that it performs a flight across the Atlantic
from Cape Horn, or about its latitude, to the Cape of Good Hope. The
smaller species, of which the present is one, do not venture on so long flights,
but several voyagers have recorded their having been seen at two to five
hundred miles out at sea.</p>
<p>On the sea-coast of America, on the Atlantic, the Albatrosses are found
inhabiting only a portion of the shores of the southern division of this continent
north of Cape Horn, but on the Pacific they are abundant throughout
the extent of the continent.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>The species that we present to the reader in the present plate, was discovered
on the coast of California by the late John K. Townsend, M. D., and
was first brought to notice by Mr. Audubon, in his Ornithological Biography,
V., p. 327, but the specimen appears to have been accompanied by no notice
of its history.</p>
<p>Since the period of its discovery, this bird has been again observed only
by Dr. Heermann, who has kindly furnished the following note from his
Journal:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Black-footed Albatross abounds on the coast of California and
southward, as do several other species of this genus. It is commonly to be
seen skimming over the waves in its flight, and following in the wake of
vessels, to pick up the refuse scraps thrown overboard. With the voracity
characteristic of these birds, it seizes with little discrimination on whatever
is thrown into the water, and of this propensity advantage may be taken by
baiting a hook, by which, when seized, the bird is easily secured. From the
stern-ports of our ship, during a voyage by sea to California, I have thus
captured eight or ten specimens of this and other species of this genus in a
single morning. All the species much resemble each other in habits, so far
as my observations extend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the coast of California, I observed a White Albatross much smaller
than the large <i>Diomedea exulans</i>, but not having succeeded in procuring it,
I cannot designate the species.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The small white species alluded to by Dr. Heermann, is probably new
to the ornithology of North America. Of the species known as inhabitants,
we may say of the Pacific ocean, several have not heretofore been noticed by
naturalists on the shores of the United States.</p>

may at once be distinguished by the color of the feet, which in the present

longer and wedge-shaped, and the upper mandible extends in a point into
the plumage of the head in front, instead of being as above described in the
species now before us.</p>
<p>It is a species apparently peculiar to the western coast of America; but as
illustrative of the very extensive range of these birds, we may mention that
several species, which are common on the Pacific coast of this continent, are
also met with on the shores of Australia. The Great Wandering Albatross,
the Dusky Albatross, and the Yellow-nosed Albatross (<i>D. exulans fuliginosa</i>
and <i>chlorhynchus</i>), are given as birds of that continent in Mr. Gould&rsquo;s magnificent
work, &ldquo;The Birds of Australia,&rdquo; and are now well known to be inhabitants
of the western shores of the continent of America.</p>

<br />PLATE XXXVI. Adult Male.</h2>
<p>Of the many birds of Western America, the history of which has been
brought to light by the recent researches of our countrymen and fellow-laborers
in the great field of zoological science, that now before the reader is
one of the most curious and interesting. Its existence has been known to
naturalists since the time of Hernandez, who, as early as 1651, in his &ldquo;New
History of the Plants, Animals, and Minerals of Mexico,&rdquo; gives a short
account of it, as one of the most remarkable of the birds that came under his
observation. Though partially known for so long a period, and having
received various names from European naturalists, who have described specimens
met with in museums, there was extant no satisfactory account of this
bird previous to the incorporation of countries which it inhabits with the
confederacy of the United States, and the consequent facilities afforded to
the investigations of American naturalists.</p>
<p>This bird is especially remarkable for great swiftness of foot, and in fact
appears to be almost unrivalled in that respect by any other of our North
American species, not even excepting the Grouse, Partridges, or any other of
the smaller gallinaceous birds. These, though possessing the ability to run
short distances very swiftly, are incapable of sustaining a protracted chase
like the present bird. In Mexico, and the adjacent portions of the United
States, it is not unusual, as a matter of amusement, to try the speed of our
bird by pursuing him on horseback, or by chasing him with dogs, under which
severe test of his fleetness, he acquits himself very creditably, and makes, as
we shall see presently, a longer race than is usually expected by his pursuer.
He evidently possesses both speed and bottom, unrivalled by any fair competition
in ornithological pedestrianism, so far as its annals are chronicled, or
the present writer&rsquo;s information on that subject extends.</p>
<p>Clothed in plumage of agreeable and unusual colors for a Northern species,
and habitually frequenting the ground, walking or running with its long tail
carried erect, and assuming a variety of grotesque attitudes, it is not surprising
that this bird has attracted the attention of nearly all our naturalists
and travellers who have visited its native regions. Through their exertions,
it is now to be found in nearly all our museums and private collections, and
many facts respecting it have been placed on record.</p>
<p>Though terrestrial in its habits, and exhibiting in some degree the manners
and habits of the gallinaceous birds (the Pheasants, Partridges, Grouse, &amp;c.),
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
this bird is by no means to be classed in that division of the ornithological
kingdom. It is a Cuckoo, and a relative of the celebrated bird of Europe so
long known as to have become classic, and of the unobtrusive and plain-plumaged
little birds of the United States, of the genus <i>Coccyzus</i>, popularly
known by the name of Cow-birds, or Rain-birds. Our present bird is a representative
of the gallinaceous form, in the family of Cuckoos. Throughout
the animal and vegetable kingdoms, and in every division or subdivision of
whatever character, five primary groups or forms present themselves. In
birds and all their groups, these are: the typical, or bird-like form; the predatory,
or rapacious; the gallinaceous, or walking; the grallatorial, or wading;
and the natatorial, or swimming form. In the group of Cuckoos, which is
quite extensive, and species of which are found in nearly all parts of the
world, the bird now before us belongs to the subdivision comprising the gallinaceous
or walking Cuckoos, and is a striking example of that peculiar form
in the great circle of birds, and of the prevalence of a law which is universal,
and not difficult to demonstrate.</p>
<p>The first American naturalist who observed the bird now before the reader,
was Dr. William Gambel, and a description by him will be found in the Proceedings
of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, Vol. II., p.
263. (1845). Subsequently, it has been noticed by nearly all naturalists who
have visited California, New Mexico, or Texas, and interesting contributions
to its history are contained in their publications relating to the ornithology
of those countries.</p>
<p>Our esteemed friend, Col. George A. McCall, with his usual clearness and
scientific accuracy, gave the first satisfactory account of this bird, in the
Proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy, III. p. 234 (July, 1847.):</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although the toes of this bird are disposed in opposite pairs, as in other
species of his family, yet the outer toe being reversible, and of great flexibility,
is in either position aptly applied in climbing or perching, as well as on
the ground. Thus he at times pitches along the ground in irregular but
vigorous hops; and again, when the outer toe is thrown forward, he runs
smoothly, and with such velocity, as to be able to elude a dog in the <i>chaparral</i>,
without taking wing. He feeds on <i>coleoptera</i>, and almost every description
of insects, and near the river Nueces, where the snail (<i>Lynn&aelig;us stagnalis</i>)
abounds, it is also greedily eaten. These he snatches from the ground, or
plucks from the low branch of a bush; and as he rarely wanders far from his
abode, the prize is carried to a particular spot, where the shell is broken with
his strong bill, and the animal devoured. Piles of these shells are often found
that would fill half a hat crown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although dwelling principally on the ground, he is ready and expert in
catching his prey in the air, in which act his movements are full of animation,&mdash;bounding
from the ground with a sudden impulse to the height of
eight or ten feet; his wings and tail are seen expanded for a scarcely appreciable
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
instant, and his bill is heard to snap as he takes his prey, when he
drops as suddenly to the spot from which he sprang. Here he will stand for
a moment, his legs apart, and his tail flirted on one side with a wild and
eccentric expression of exultation in his attitude, before he scampers off
under cover of the thick <i>chaparral</i>. At first, I thought,&mdash;as is the general
impression among the Mexicans,&mdash;that his powers of flight were extremely
limited; but he will, when suddenly alarmed in open ground, rise with a light,
quick motion, and continue his flight over the bushes for some hundred yards,
apparently with an ease that would argue the ability to sustain a longer
flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though fond of solitude and shade, he will, at an early hour in the morning,
climb to the top of a straight leafless branch, there to sit and enjoy the
first rays of the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is said by the Mexican rancheros to build his nest of loose sticks,
either in a low, thick bush, or in close cover on the ground. The eggs are
said by them to be two or three in number, and of a whitish color.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have again to express our obligations to Col. McCall for the following
contribution to our present article:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never was so fortunate as to find the nest of this bird, yet I had frequent
opportunities of witnessing its manners and habits in Texas, in New Mexico,
and in California, between the years 1846-52.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of shy and retiring disposition, the <i>G. viaticus</i> is most often met with
singly. I have, however, frequently seen the male and female associated
during the later period of the year, as well as in spring and summer; the
former, at all seasons, being easily distinguishable by his larger size and more
brilliant plumage. Whether the pairs I thus met were mated for life, or for
the year, or were merely accidentally living in company, I am unable to say&mdash;I
simply state the fact; and I well recollect my fruitless efforts, in Texas,
for several successive days in autumn, to secure a pair that inhabited a large
<i>chaparral</i> near which I happened to be encamped at the time. The male
was a remarkably fine bird, but evidently an old and cautious fellow; he
would come just without the thicket, followed by the female&mdash;and there, with
neck outstretched, cast a searching glance around; then, if an enemy
appeared, even in the distance, he would instantly retreat to his impenetrable
abode trebly fenced with thorns. In a little while, he would re-appear at
another point, where, if the coast seemed clear, he would, closely followed by
his mate, begin to search for grass-hoppers and other insects, but never venture
more than a few paces from the border of the thicket. Thus it was
impossible to approach him in open ground; and such was his constant
caution and vigilance that, although I more than once lay in wait for the
couple, which I regularly saw in the morning hours, I never succeeded in
getting within gunshot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When suddenly surprised, I have seen this bird rise on wing and fly considerable
distances, in order to gain close cover, the flight being effected by
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
regular flappings, and executed, apparently, with ease; though the bird did
not rise more than six or eight feet from the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The individuals that I killed in the fall and winter seasons, invariably
were excessively fat, and their crops were usually filled with snails and various
coleoptera. I do not recollect that I ever found in their stomachs the remains
of lizards or other reptiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Paisano</i> (countryman), as this bird is called by the Mexicans, or
<i>Corre-camino</i> (run-the-road), as the native Californians designate it, is often
met in the unfrequented roads that traverse forests of low brushwood, being
enticed from its sombre retreats to the openings, in search of its favorite
food. And here is often afforded the traveller an opportunity of witnessing
its surpassing swiftness of foot. I have several times tested its speed with a
good horse under me, and I have in truth been astonished at the almost
incredible rate at which it passed over the ground. On one occasion, when
approaching Limpia creek (W. Texas), with a small party, on my way to
El Paso, I discovered a fine male <i>Paisano</i> in the open road, about one hundred
yards in advance. For amusement, I put spurs to my horse and dashed
after him, followed by one of my men. For full four hundred yards, I ran
him along a road level and smooth as a floor; and over which, with straightened
neck and slightly-expanded wings, he swiftly glided, seeming scarcely to
touch the ground. And when, at last, he deemed it prudent to seek shelter
in the thicket alongside, I had not reduced the distance between us more
than fifty yards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was told on the frontier that the Mexican rancheros do sometimes run
down and capture the <i>Paisano</i> when they find him wandering on more open
ground; and such I think is probable, for the one to which I have just
referred was going, even to the moment at which he <i>took cover</i>, at a rate of
speed that could not possibly have been much longer sustained; nor could
he, I think, when so nearly &lsquo;blown,&rsquo; have risen on wing. Such, at least, is
the case with the wild turkey, which I have repeatedly captured in the same
way, although his power of flight is greater than that of the <i>Paisano</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Capt. John P. McCown, of the United States Army, also observed the
<i>Paisano</i> in Texas; and in his observations on the birds of that State, in the
Annals of the New York Lyceum of Natural History, VI. p. 9, we find the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Often in my wanderings through the <i>chapparel</i> on the Rio Grande, I
observed piles of broken snail shells, and always near some hard substance,
such as a bone, or hard piece of wood, which had evidently been used in
breaking the shells. I made many conjectures as to the probable animal,
but never suspected that a bird had left these evidences of its peculiar habits.
I heard, also, at times, generally in the morning or evening, a sound very
similar to that made by some Woodpeckers, rapidly beating their bills upon
an old dry tree. This was also a mystery, as I could find no Woodpeckers
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
near the place where the sound came from. Upon inquiry of a Mexican, I
was told that it was the <i>Paisano</i> breaking the snail-shells to get at the snail,
which explained at once both the noise and the mutilated shells. I was afterwards
so fortunate as to see a bird so occupied. It took the snail in its bill
and beat it upon the hard substance, striking faster and faster, until the
shell broke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few of these birds are to be found on the Rio Nueces. They run with
great speed, seldom taking to wing. I have seen them on trees apparently
observing the vicinity. I had a young bird of this species, about half-grown,
but it refused to eat, and soon died; and I have seen some in coops, and have
been informed that they have been tamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When approached, this bird runs very swiftly until near cover, when it
stops and reconnoitres the intruder, gives its tail a flirt, and away it goes
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1846, on the mountains between Monterey and Saltillo, I saw a pair
of birds much like these, but much smaller. I observed them for some time,
and feel satisfied that they were another species. The snail that seems to
form the principal food of these birds is found sticking to almost every bush,
and some are literally covered with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In California, this bird was frequently noticed by Dr. Heermann, from
whose manuscripts in our possession we have permission to make the following
extract:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found this bird throughout California inhabiting the most arid portions
of the country. It often crossed our path, or ran before us for a short
distance on the road, dashing, when alarmed, immediately into the <i>chapparel</i>,
in which its swiftness of foot enabled it to readily elude pursuit. It may,
however, be overtaken when followed on horseback over the vast open plains
in which it is found, if no friendly bush offers it a shelter. When closely
chased, if on an elevated point, it will sometimes fly, but appears to prefer
sailing downwards. I once saw a specimen captured by a couple of dogs,
their appetites whetted by recent success in overtaking and bringing down a
Prairie wolf, or cayote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stomachs of all the specimens that I examined of this bird were filled
with the grass-hoppers and large black beetles found on the plains. The
nest, built on the branches of the cactus, is formed of loose sticks, thrown
negligently together, in the same manner as that of the yellow-billed Cuckoo
of the United States (<i>Coccyzus americanus</i>). It contains two large, nearly
spherical, white eggs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never witnessed the following, but was gravely assured of its truth
by several old Californians: It is said that this bird, on perceiving the
rattlesnake coiled up asleep, will collect the cactus and hedge him around in
a circle, out of which he is prevented from escaping by the prickly points
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
opposing him on every side; and becoming enraged, strikes himself, and dies
from the effects of his self-inoculated venom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bird is common in Western Texas and on the Rio Grande.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This remarkable bird has been found in the vicinity of Fort Webster, New
Mexico, by Dr. Henry, and was also noticed in that country and in Texas by
Mr. Clark, Mr. Schott, and Dr. Kennerly, and in Mexico by Lieut. Couch.</p>
<p>Though neither of the authors above cited have mentioned that this bird
devours reptiles as well as insects and snails, that fact is stated by Dr. Gambel
in his paper on the Birds of California, in the first volume of the quarto Journal
of the Philadelphia Academy, and it is so represented in some spirited sketches
by Mr. Arthur Schott, now attached to the United States and Mexican Boundary
Surveying party, whose drawings of this bird made in its native wilds
are in the possession of our valued friend, Professor Baird, of the Smithsonian
Institution. It is probable that although it may prefer insects, other small
animals afford suitable food.</p>
<p>Lieut. D. N. Couch, of the U. S. Army, to whom we have been indebted
for other valuable contributions, has, with his usual kindness, added to our
present article the following interesting notice of this bird as an inhabitant
of Northern Mexico:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bird was first met with in Southwestern Texas, near the Rio Grande,
where it is called &lsquo;Prairie Cock&rsquo; by the inhabitants. Few or no opportunities
occurred for me to observe it carefully, until I found myself in the
dreary chapparel districts of Tamaulipas, and next beyond the Sierra
Madre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chapparel is its home. Equally avoiding the forests of high trees
or the open prairies,&mdash;in the former of which its short wings would preclude
an easy flight to the branches, and in the latter, for the same reason, it would
be unable to escape from the numerous hawks of various species that are ever
hovering over the arid wastes of that region. Once only I saw it perched
near the top of a stout Mesquite tree, though not many feet from the
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as I have observed, this bird rarely takes to wing, but with head
lowered and tail nearly horizontal; crouching to the ground, it runs without
using its wings, with incredible swiftness; stopping suddenly, its long and
beautiful tail is raised and depressed with as much grace as a fan in the hand
of an accomplished senorita.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In one of my excursions, I saw a wolf chase a hare (<i>Lepus texianus</i>), but
was distanced in a few seconds, in the short race, a bird of this species was
started, and the wolf in turn tried its fleetness, with the same result very distinctly
arrived at. Apparently much disappointed, he looked at me for a
moment, with an expression that seemed to say, &ldquo;I have half a mind to try
you;&rdquo; but he turned off sulkily and trotted away, leaving me quite satisfied
with his conclusion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pa-i-san-o is the name by which this bird is known to the Mexicans.
They hold it in high estimation on account of its enmity to the rattlesnake,
which it usually succeeds in killing in fair combat. Notwithstanding that it
is by no means deficient in courage, there is scarcely one of the feathered
tribe that is so quiet and harmless in its habits. I have never noticed any
note except a weak scream, and that very seldom. It is apparently not
social, never occurring in flocks, not a wanderer to much extent, and though
almost a hermit, is the most pleasing and friendly-looking inhabitant that
lives only in the chapparel.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Obs.</span> As the reader will have discovered from our preceding synonymes,
an unusual superabundance of names has been proposed for this bird. We
have no doubt, however, that it is the <i>Hoitlallotl</i> of Hernandez (Nova, plantarum,
animalium et mineralium Mexicanorum, Historia, p. 25. Folio, Rome,
1651), whose description is cited by both Buffon and Latham. On the faith
of the notice by the latter (Synopsis of Birds, II. p. 723), Gmelin gave the
name <i>Phasianus mexicanus</i> as cited above. The description by Hernandez
is short and not very accurate; but we could mention many species of birds,
the original descriptions of which are quite as much so, both ancient and
modern. Prof. Wagler, in his description of <i>Geococcyx variegatus</i>, above
alluded to, expresses the opinion that his bird is the same as that described
by Hernandez; and Mr. Strickland, in Ann. and Mag. of Nat. Hist., VIII.
p. 544 (1842), arrives at the same conclusion.</p>
<p>We regard it as at least possible, too, that this bird is the <i>Upupa mexicana</i>
(Gmelin, Syst. Nat., I. p. 467), which is the &ldquo;Mexican Promerops&rdquo; (Latham,
Syn., II. p. 691). The descriptions are founded on a figure in Seba (pl. 45,
fig. 3), that about as accurately represents this species as any other; which
can also be said of his description. In Seba&rsquo;s figure it will be observed that
three toes are directed forward, which might appear to be a difficulty; but in
reference to that point we ask attention to Col. McCall&rsquo;s valuable contribution
in a preceding page. There is, too, some peculiarity intended or
attempted to be represented in the figure to which we allude.</p>
<p>The sexes of this bird differ in size very considerably; and there are, also,
variations in size and measurements, such as comparative lengths of their
bills and tails between different specimens. We have seen a large number
of specimens, from various localities, but of one species only. Though we
have been constantly on the watch for it, we have never detected the smaller
species alluded to by Captain McCown, which is very probably <i>Geococcyx
affinis</i>, described by Dr. George Hartlaub, of the State Museum of Bremen,
one of the most learned and accurate of European ornithologists. That
species may be more an inhabitant of the mountainous or hilly country than
the subject of our present article.</p>

<br />The Long-billed Flycatcher. The Whip-tom-kelly. The John-to-whit.
<br />PLATE XXXVII. Adult Male.</h2>
<p>This little bird is very similar in form and general appearance to the Red-eyed
Flycatcher (<i>Vireosylvia olivacea</i>), of the United States, but is larger,
and is distinctly characterized by the dark line on the side of the neck. It
appears to possess much the same habits as the common species just mentioned,
and others that inhabit the northern division of the continent of
America. Passing its life, for the greater part, searching for insects amongst
the thick foliage of the forest, in which its color favors concealment, it utters
its peculiar notes, evidently of the same general character, but much louder
and quite different from those of either of its northern brethren.</p>
<p>Though long known as a bird of the West Indies, and represented by Mr.
Gosse to be abundant in the Island of Jamaica, it has but recently been discovered
within the limits of the United States. Vieillot, it is true, gave it
as a North American species, and in his fine work, which is of standard value
in the history of our birds, figures it accurately, but from specimens obtained
in the West Indies. It was first ascertained to be a summer visitor in Florida,
by Dr. A. L. Heermann, who observed it in considerable numbers in that
State, at a season when it was certainly engaged in the duties of incubation;
but it has as yet never been noticed in any other part of the United States.
It is probable, too, that it inhabits Cuba, but the several able naturalists of
that Island have not detected it, or at least have not stated it to be different
from the common Red-eyed Flycatcher.</p>
<p>For our article on this bird, Dr. Heermann has, with great kindness,
furnished the following notice:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlotte Harbour is situated on the Gulf of Mexico, and is studded with
numerous small islands or keys, as they are called, on which grows the cocoa-nut,
said to be brought hither from the West Indies by the tides, and being
thrown on the shore, takes root and flourishes. Some of these islands, during
my visit, I may say almost swarmed with Herons, Cormorants, Snake-birds,
Spoonbills, and Pelicans, engaged in attending to their nests, and raising
their young. The wild fig, orange, lemon, palmetto, and pine, abound&mdash;the
first of which is the principal food of several species of birds, while the large
numbers of fishes everywhere in the surrounding waters afford ample subsistence
to those that I have mentioned. On the sand-bars, various species
of Terns were to be found in abundance, also engaged in incubation, while
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
the Fish Crow, ever on the alert to seize the eggs or young, or the captured
prey of any of these species when left unguarded, was ever to be seen on the
wing, and at a distance, and not to be approached easily, I have frequently
seen flocks of Flamingoes dredging perseveringly for shell-fishes, or standing
in groups, looking almost like files of soldiers in red uniforms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mention these birds because, like the little Long-billed Flycatcher, and
like the cocoa-nut, too, if the prevailing belief is correct, they appear to be
visitors only from a more southern clime. They seem to have reached Florida
in the course of a northern migration, and although remaining for a season,
retire periodically, again to appear in due time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this vicinity, I met with the Long-billed Flycatcher, which, coming
with his larger and more conspicuous fellow-travellers, to which I have
alluded, appears to be a more transient visitant, performing the duties of
incubation on this the northern district of his range, and soon retiring southwardly
to the West Indies. This bird much resembles in manners and
appearance the Red-eyed Flycatcher of the Northern States, but is not, I
think, its equal as a vocalist. His notes, at the season when I heard them,
were not as numerous, nor his song so long-continued. They are quite
different from those of the Red-eye, but clear and musical, and very distinctly
uttered. He is constantly on the search for insects, and appeared to me to
be more active than either of the northern species, darting about amongst
the foliage, or peering into a crevice or recess in a branch, or a spider&rsquo;s
web, with his back downwards, like the warblers,&mdash;or occasionally chasing a
flying insect, in the manner of the Pewee Flycatchers. These actions were
usually accompanied by his song, as is the case with the Red-eye and the
Warbling Flycatchers. This species was not abundant, though I saw it frequently,
and obtained several specimens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The name, &ldquo;Whip-tom-kelly,&rdquo; is applied to this bird in Brown&rsquo;s Jamaica,
one of the standard authorities on that Island (the Civil and Natural History
of Jamaica, by Patrick Brown, M. D., London, 1789, folio), as its popular
appellation, and has been transferred to the works of various authors. Mr.
Gosse, however, in his pleasant volume on the Birds of Jamaica, mentions
that he had never heard this designation.</p>
<p>The naturalists of Jamaica and Cuba appear to have considered this bird
as identical with the Red-eyed Flycatcher. The latter may be a visitor, most
probably, in the winter, to these islands, but the present is undoubtedly the
resident summer species, at least in Jamaica. The figure in Edward&rsquo;s Gleanings
of Natural History (V. pl. 253), is particularly stated to have been made
from Dr. Brown&rsquo;s specimen brought from Jamaica, and clearly represents the
present bird. Mr. Swainson, in Fauna Boreali Americana, Birds, p. 237, in
his description of <i>Vireo longirostris</i>, which is this bird, mentions having
received specimens from the Islands of Jamaica and St. Vincent.</p>
<p>As a bird of Jamaica, this little Flycatcher is described in his usually
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
agreeable manner, by Mr. Gosse, in his work above alluded to. Holding
ourselves in duty bound, we take the liberty of transcribing from his pages
as followeth, premising that he calls this bird the &ldquo;John-to-whit:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much oftener heard than seen, though not unfamiliar to either sense, this
sober-colored bird is one of those whose notes have such a similarity to articulations
as to procure them a common appellation. The Flycatchers, in
general, are not very vociferous, but this is pertinacious in its tritonous call,
repeating it with energy every two or three seconds. It does not ordinarily
sit on a prominent twig, or dart out after insects, though I have seen one in
eager but unsuccessful pursuit of a butterfly (<i>Terias</i>); but it seems to love
the centre of thick woods, where it sits announcing its presence, or flits from
bough to bough as you approach, so that it is not easy to get a sight of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bird does not winter with us, but leaves with the Grey Petchary
(<i>Tyrannus Dominicensis</i>), at the beginning of October. It returns early&mdash;and
like the bird just named, evidently makes an eastward progress, arriving
at the southwest end of the island first. On the 26th of March, on my return
to Bluefields, after a visit to Spanishtown, I heard its well-known voice, but
my lad had noticed it a week before. From this time, every grove, I might
almost say every tree, had its bird, uttering, with incessant iteration and untiring
energy, from its umbrageous concealment, &rsquo;<i>Sweet-John!&mdash;John-to-whit!&mdash;Sweet-John-to-whit!&mdash;John-t&rsquo;-whit!&mdash;Sweet-John-to&mdash;whit!</i>&rsquo;
I can
scarcely understand how the call can be written &lsquo;Whip-tom-kelly,&rsquo; as the
accent, if I may so say, is most energetic on the last syllable. Nor have I
ever heard this appellation given to it in Jamaica. After July, we rarely
hear &lsquo;<i>John-to-whit</i>&rsquo;&mdash;but, &lsquo;<i>to-whit&mdash;to-whoo</i>,&rsquo; and sometimes a soft, simple
chirp, or <i>sip, sip</i>, whispered so gently as scarcely to be audible. This, however,
I have reason to believe is the note of the young, for I have heard
young ones repeatedly utter it, when sitting on a twig, receiving from time
to time, with gaping beak and quivering wing, the food contributed by the
dam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The food of the John-to-whit is both animal and vegetable. In March,
I have found in its stomach the seeds of the tropic birch, and in April, the
berries of sweet-wood, in an unripe state. In the same month, I observed
one hunting insects by the borders of Bluefields rivulet, in which I was
bathing, and so intent was it upon its occupation, that it allowed me to
approach within a foot of it before it flew. It sought insects successfully
among the grass and low herbage, perching on the stalks of the weeds, and
jumping out after stationary, as well as vagrant, prey. I observed it eat
two spider&rsquo;s nests, which it masticated as if peculiarly savory. As it sat, it
vomited a little white body, which I found to be the globose seed of the
misletoe berry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incubation takes place in June and July. The nest is rather a neat structure,
though made of coarse materials. It is a deep cup, about as large as
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
an ordinary tea-cup, narrowed at the mouth, composed of dried grass, intermixed
with silk-cotton, and sparingly with lichen and spiders&rsquo; nests, and
lined with thatch-threads. It is usually suspended between two twigs, or in
the fork of one, the margin being over-woven so as to embrace the twigs.
This is very neatly performed. Specimens vary much in beauty,&mdash;one before
me is particularly neat and compact, being almost globular in form, except
that about one-fourth of the globe is wanting, as it is a cup. Though the walls
are not thick, they are very firm and close, the materials being well woven.
These are fibres of grass-like plants, moss, a few dry leaves, flat papery
spiders&rsquo; nests, with a little cotton or down for the over-binding of the edges.
It is lined smoothly with fibres, I know not of what plant, as slender as
human hair. Another nest, similarly formed, has the cavity almost filled with
a mass of white cotton, which looks as if thrust in by man, but that those
filaments of the mass that are in contact with the sides, are interwoven with
the other materials. As it is picked cotton, it must be a bit stolen from some
house or yard, not plucked by the bird from the capsule. The eggs, commonly
three in number, are delicately white, with a few small red-brown spots
thinly scattered over the surface, sometimes very minute and few. Their form
is a somewhat pointed oval, measuring nine-tenths of an inch by rather less
than thirteen-twentieths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our figure is about three-fourths of the size of life, and represents the
adult male from one of Dr. Heermann&rsquo;s specimens obtained in Florida.</p>

<br />The Long-billed Swamp Sparrow.
<br />PLATE XXXVIII. Adult Male.</h2>
<p>Of this bird we can give but a very imperfect history. It is one of a
group of Sparrows, of which other species inhabit North America, characterized
in some measure like the present, by the length and large size of their
bills, and their partiality for the vicinity of salt water. Two species, the
Sea-side Finch, and the Sharp-tailed Finch (<i>Ammodromus maritimus</i> and
<i>caudacutus</i>), are of frequent occurrence on the shores of the Atlantic, almost
throughout the extent of the coast of the temperate regions of North America,&mdash;and
in New Jersey may be met with in the summer season in considerable
numbers, wherever there are salt marshes, or that description of
vegetation peculiar to the shores of the ocean, or within reach of its tides.
In those localities, frequently of difficult access, these birds rear their young
in comparative safety, subsisting on seeds and insects, and seldom attracting
attention. They may occasionally be seen, too, on the bare sands of the
beach, searching for small marine animals thrown up by the waves.</p>
<p>The present bird is a representative of this group on the shores of the
Pacific, and from the notice by its discoverer, which we shall give directly, it
appears to be very similar in its habits. It was first observed by Dr. Heermann,
near San Diego, California, during his first visit to that country, and
has since that time been again noticed only by him. Specimens in excellent
plumage and preservation, from his collections, are in the National Museum,
Washington city, and in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences
of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>This bird was first described in the Proceedings of the Philadelphia
Academy, VI. p. 184 (Oct., 1852). For our present article, Dr. Heermann
has kindly permitted us to make the following extract from his Journals, kept
during his former and recent visits to California:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1851, I procured this bird on the shores of the Bay of San Diego,
where, in company with other species, it appeared to be engaged in searching
for grass-seeds. During the late Pacific Railroad survey by the party under
command of Lieut. Williamson, I again saw it in considerable numbers at
Santa Barbara and San Pedro. At the latter places, as at San Diego, it
frequents the low, sandy beach, and the heavy sedge-grass which abounds on
the shores, feeding on marine insects and seeds thrown up by the tides on the
former, and in the latter, finding quick and easy concealment when alarmed
or pursued. It appears to be a quiet, unsuspicious bird, and I heard it utter
only a short, sharp chirp during the limited time that I had to observe it.&rdquo;</p>

<br />PLATE XXXIX. Adult Male and Female in Summer Plumage.</h2>
<p>It is not only in the spring, or at the advent of the month sung by the
poets as the real birth of the year, that everywhere in the temperate regions
of North America, hosts of feathered travellers arrive, either to remain for a
season, or to continue their journey to more northern countries. In the
autumn and winter, also, troops of them constantly appear, succeeding each
other in some measure according to the earlier or later setting in of winter,
or the greater or less severity of that season. Nearly all of the autumnal
species, like our summer visitors, proceed to the South to spend the winter&mdash;others,
coming later, remain during the whole of the winter, and are constantly
recruited by new comers of the same species, but at the first opening
of spring, return to their homes. Some, as the Purple Finch and the little
Snow-bird, come every winter&mdash;others, as the Pine Grosbeak, the Northern
Linnet, and the two species of Crossbills, only occasionally. Though abundant,
perhaps, for one season, years may elapse before either of the birds
last mentioned will be seen again by the most diligent collector. At the
time of writing the present article (December, 1853), both the White-winged
Crossbill and the common Crossbill (<i>Loxia leucoptera</i> and <i>americana</i>), are
abundant in the neighborhood of Philadelphia, the former of which has not
before been seen here since the winter of 1835-6. The latter appears more
frequently.</p>
<p>In addition to these, we are visited by flocks of several species that are to
be found here rearing their young in the summer; but while our bird reared
in Pennsylvania has taken an excursion to the South, so his Northern namesake,
reared, perhaps, at Hudson&rsquo;s Bay, has done the same, and made Pennsylvania
the limit of his journey. The Robin (<i>Merula migratoria</i>) is an
instance of this description of migration. This bird, in large flocks, is to be
met with almost every winter, especially in New Jersey, and wanders much
further southwardly and westward. We fancy that we can distinguish a
stranger of this species from one &ldquo;native and to the manor born.&rdquo; The
Northern Robin is slightly a larger bird than our summer resident; his colors
are a shade darker, and his bill decidedly a clearer yellow. Though not
presenting characters sufficient at all to raise a suspicion of distinction in
species, the northern bird is clearly of a different race. And so it is, too,
with the Red-winged Blackbird, the Meadow Lark, the Golden-winged and
the Red-headed Woodpeckers, and other species, all of which come here in
the winter from more northern latitudes, and in most of which close observation
will detect small characteristics of difference in race.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>The spring migration is confined to birds that pass the winter in the South,
in many cases not beyond the limits of the United States; but there are
birds that extend their journey to the islands of the West Indies, to Mexico,
and to Central America, and in some instances to South America. Many of
the Warblers, several of our common Thrushes and Finches, and various
others of our well-known North American species, visit Cuba and Jamaica in
the course of the winter, and in both those islands some of them make their
appearance while yet the season is not so far advanced in the United States
as to incommode them either by the cold or an abridged supply of their
favorite food.</p>
<p>The migration of these birds is a curious problem, and regulated by laws
entirely independent of the considerations of climate and supply of food.
One cannot readily find a reason why a bird that has passed the winter in a
tropical or southern latitude, should leave for the North at the coming of
spring, when a more plentiful supply of food than has sufficed for its winter
support is about to be presented. And then, too, why should birds proceed
so far to the North?&mdash;to the very confines of the Arctic circle, as many
small species do, when the great forests of the middle and northern States
offer ample accommodation, and supplies of food certainly equal to those in
which they will at last terminate their journey. There are questions here
difficult to answer. It would appear that the existence of an animal is predicated
on its performance of certain functions antecedently involved in its
organization. That its entire history, we may say, is but an answer to the
calls of organization. That the organization and the performance of its indicated
functions are strictly exponents of each other, the latter modified by
circumstances, and the relations of species to each other, dependent in some
measure on circumstances, but not produced by them, no more than forms or
other physical characters. No feature in the history of an animal is absolutely
produced by circumstances. There is, too, the consideration of inherited
instincts, and if the faculty of memory, and impressions on it, are
transmissible, nearly the whole phenomena of instinct may be explained.</p>
<p>In the western and southwestern countries of North America, within the
limits of the United States, various species of northern birds appear in winter
that have never been noticed on the Atlantic seaboard. The handsome little
bird that we present to the reader in the plate now before him, is one of that
description. It appears to be a native of the extensive and little-known
regions of northwestern America, migrating in the winter to California, New
Mexico, and Texas, where it has been seen by several of our naturalists.</p>
<p>There are several species in Western America of the group to which this
bird belongs, all characterized by agreeable and somewhat similar colors. In
the States on the Atlantic, the Snow Bunting (<i>Plectrophanes nivalis</i>) is their
only relative that is of usual occurrence,&mdash;though another, the Lapland
<span class="pb" id="Page_230">230</span>
Longspur (<i>Plectrophanes Lapponica</i>), occasionally appears, and of the
capture of which, in the neighborhood of Philadelphia, several instances have
come to our knowledge.</p>
<p>Capt. McCown, who discovered this present species in Texas, gives no
further account of it than that he shot it in company with a flock of Shore
Larks. His notice is in the Annals of the New York Lyceum of Natural
History, VI. p. 14. Dr. Henry has obtained it in the vicinity of Fort
Thorne, New Mexico. These, with Dr. Heermann, are the only naturalists
that have as yet noticed this bird in its native wilds.</p>
<p>During the survey for a route for a railroad to the Pacific, by Lieut. Williamson&rsquo;s
party, to which Dr. Heermann was attached, he met with this bird
in large numbers, and his collection contains numerous specimens in various
stages of plumage. From these we have selected adults of both sexes, from
which the plate now before the reader has been prepared. In Dr. Heermann&rsquo;s
manuscripts, kindly placed at our disposal for the purposes of our
present work, we find this bird thus noticed:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found this species congregated in large flocks with the chestnut-collared
Lark Bunting (<i>Plectrophanes ornatus</i>), and engaged in gleaning the seeds
from the scanty grass on the vast arid plains of New Mexico. Insects and
berries also form part of their food, in search of which they show considerable
activity, running on the ground with ease and celerity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found this bird, as well as various other species, particularly abundant
whenever we struck on the isolated water-holes that occur in this region,
these being the only spots for miles around where water can be obtained.
When fired at, or otherwise alarmed, they rise as if to fly away, but seem to
be irresistibly impelled by thirst to return to the only localities where relief
is to be obtained, and where, if the hunter is so inclined, large numbers
of this handsome little bird, and others, may be slaughtered with little
exertion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Dr. T. C. Henry, of the U. S. Army, I learned that in the spring,
large flocks of this species appear at Fort Thorne, apparently on their return
to the North, having migrated southwardly the fall previous, and that they
leave on the return of mild weather. In several flocks of these birds I noticed
also the Shore Lark (<i>Alanda alpestris</i>), but it formed a small proportion
of the numbers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The figures in our plate are about two-thirds of the size of life.</p>

<br />The Western Avocet. The White Avocet.
<br />PLATE XL. Adult Male.</h2>
<p>This is a second American species of this singular group of birds, and is
as yet only known as an inhabitant of the regions of the far west. This
apparent restriction in the locality of the present bird is the more remarkable,
as the previously-known species, distinguished as the American Avocet
(<i>Recurvirostra americana</i>), is widely diffused, having been ascertained to be
abundant in the vicinity of Hudson&rsquo;s Bay in the summer season, and thence,
through a wide central region of North America, to Texas. Occasionally it
is noticed on the coast of the Atlantic, sparingly north of New Jersey, but
becoming more numerous southwardly.</p>
<p>This species was discovered at San Francisco, California, by the naturalists
attached to H. B. M. ship Blossom, then on a voyage of discovery in the
Pacific ocean; and although that occurred about the year 1825, it has been
again noticed only by Col. McCall and Dr. Heermann, both of whom, however,
represent it as being by no means a rare bird.</p>
<p>With his usual kindness, Col. McCall has furnished the following notice
of this bird for our present article:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the village of San Elizario, 22 miles south of El Paso, on the 16th
October, 1851, I found small flocks of the Western Avocet feeding along the
banks of the Rio Grande, and frequenting the sloughs and pools in its
vicinity, whilst moving to the South in the course of their regular autumnal
migration. They were tame and unsuspicious, and evidently ignorant of the
destructive character of the gun, for its report seemed to create little alarm,
even when the discharge carried death into their ranks. To illustrate this, I
need only mention the fact that the first flock which came immediately under
my observation alighted within twenty yards of the piazza where I was sitting
on the morning after my arrival. They waded at once into the shoal water
of a &lsquo;<i>cut-off</i>&rsquo; from the river which passed immediately in front of the house,
and began to feed. I was near enough to see them immerse their bills into
the water, and search the soft mud below for their prey; and as they, from
time to time, were scattered, and again assembled in a group, I had ample
time and an excellent opportunity to note their manner of feeding. I was
soon satisfied that in this respect their habits did not differ from those of
<i>R. americana</i>, which I had previously seen in great numbers, and closely
observed on the borders of the Oso river, in southern Texas. After watching
them for some time, I took my gun, and at a single discharge, secured five
of the dozen that composed the flock. The remainder flew the distance of a
stone&rsquo;s throw, and alighting in shoal water, began to feed again without
appearing to notice the loss of their companions. I followed them, and in a
few minutes procured three more within one hundred yards of the house.
During that day, and several successive days that I remained at the post, I
saw flocks of from six to ten on their feeding grounds, both morning and
afternoon. I shot them, as well as ducks and snipe, daily; and at no time
that I recollect, had I any difficulty in approaching within easy gun-shot.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>&ldquo;A few days previously, I had seen a very large flock of these birds near
<i>Val Verde</i>, some 170 miles further up the river. This flock contained fifty
or sixty birds; they rose near me as I fired at a flock of Teal, and circled
round in very compact order, presenting the beautiful contrast of their white
and black markings, and at length settled on the opposite side of the pond,
where they were beyond pursuit. The occasions here mentioned are the only
ones on which I have met with <i>R. occidentalis</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the wing, the flocks were usually closely compacted; the flight was
buoyant, and with little exertion of muscular force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Heermann found this bird in California, and procured numerous specimens,
now in the National Museum, Washington, and in the Museum of the
Philadelphia Academy. In his manuscripts We find the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This species was observed in various parts of California, resorting to the
shallow pools, in which it waded breast-deep, usually finding on the soft
muddy bottom a plentiful feast of insects and snails. Although partially
web-footed, it does not swim, so far as I have noticed, unless wounded, when
it takes immediately to the deep water, swimming with great celerity, soon
getting beyond range, if not at once disabled by a second shot. I have noticed
this bird in abundance on the borders of the reedy swamps which cover
a large portion of the lower part of the Sacramento valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The upward curve of the bill in the birds of this group, though very singular
and characteristic, has not been ascertained to be indicative of any
peculiarity of habits.</p>

<dl class="undent"><dt>1. <span class="sc">Caprimulgus macromystax.</span> Wagler, Isis, XXIV. p. 533. (1831.)</dt></dl>
<p>This species is noticed by Wagler, as above, from a Mexican specimen, and
his description is essentially a comparison with the <i>Caprimulgus europ&aelig;us</i>.
It is stated that the bristles at the base of the bill are very long, or &ldquo;nearly
as long as the head without the bill,&rdquo; and the plumage generally bearing a
resemblance to the European species mentioned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>There is in the collection of the Philadelphia Academy, a specimen from
Mexico, and another from California, differing in shade of color only from
the <i>Antrostomus vociferus</i>, and from which the distinctive characters are too
slight to establish a separate species. We regard these specimens as <i>C. macromystax</i>.
The length of the bristles in Wagler&rsquo;s description applies as well
to <i>A. vociferus</i>, and we think it probable that his name is a synonyme.</p>
<p>The following is a translation of Wagler&rsquo;s description or notice as above
cited, and is at the end of an elaborate and valuable paper, in which he
describes several new American species of birds:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the conclusion of these descriptions of birds, I will yet remark that
we have received from Mexico, also, a Caprimulgus (which specimen unfortunately
is without the tail), that nearly resembles ours in size and color, but
which nevertheless may be distinguished at a glance; the tarsi on their upper
sides are hardly feathered to the middle, and the bristles on both sides of
the upper mandible are uncommonly stiff, and longer than in any other
American Night Swallow, nearly as long as the head without the bill, and are
turned <i>rake-like</i> obliquely downwards. I have named it, therefore, <i>Caprimulgus
macromystax</i>. The feet are short, as in ours; also as in ours, the
claw of the middle toe on its inner border is pectinated, the primaries are
small, the second, third, and fourth, externally from their middles to their
ends, are strongly sinuated; they are brown-black, without white spots, but
have internally and externally rust-red angular dots.&rdquo;</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>2. <span class="sc">Caprimulgus minor.</span> Forster. Catalogue of the Animals of North America, p. 13. London, 1771.</dt></dl>
<p>A name given without being accompanied by a description, though probably
applicable to <i>Antrostomus vociferus</i>, which was known to some of the older
naturalists, and, previous to the introduction of the binomial nomenclature,
was called <i>minor</i>, in distinction from the <i>Caprimulgus europ&aelig;us</i>.</p>
<p>The catalogue by Forster above referred to is a pamphlet, and is, so far as
We know, the first attempt at an enumeration of the species of all classes of
animals inhabiting North America. There is also a catalogue of the Plants
of North America by the same author.</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>3. <span class="sc">Antrostomus californianus.</span> Bonaparte, Cons. Av. p. 61. (1849.)</dt></dl>
<p>The description by the Prince of Canino, as above, is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;(Confer Capr. nuttalli, Aud. Am. Orn., 2d edit., t. 495,) ex California,
Vix Turdi magnitudine. Mas. Griseus, nucha fulvescenti, abdomine cervino,
nigro undulato; gula macula utrinque alba nigro terminata: remigibus fuscis,
macula mediana alba, rectricibus lateralibus nigricantibus, extima late ad
apicem candida.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The characters here given differ so essentially from those of any other
species of <i>Antrostomus</i>, that we much suspect that the bird alluded to neither
belongs to this genus, nor is an American species.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<dl class="undent"><dt>4. <span class="sc">Caprimulgus europ&aelig;us.</span> Linn.</dt></dl>
<p>This name occurs in several of the older authors on American Natural
History, which is to be attributed to the fact that the <i>Whip-poor-will</i> (<i>Antrostomus
vociferus</i>) was regarded by Linn&aelig;us as a variety only of the European
Goatsucker. President Jefferson, in Notes on the State of Virginia, p. 117
(London edition, 1787), gives both of the then known North American birds
of this group as two varieties only of the European bird. Professor Barton,
in Fragments of the Natural History of Pennsylvania, p. 14, under the head
of <i>Caprimulgus europ&aelig;us</i>, says: &ldquo;This, or a variety of it, is certainly a
native of Pennsylvania. So that now all the fifteen species of this genus
(mentioned by Gmelin) are known to be natives of America.&rdquo; Both of these
distinguished and venerated fathers of American zoological science adopted
the opinion of Linn&aelig;us, and the name of the European bird is given also on
the same authority by some others of the earlier American writers.</p>
<p>The European Goatsucker has never been observed on the continent of
America.</p>
<p>Professor Barton&rsquo;s observation above quoted is singularly suggestive.
Linn&aelig;us, at the date of his last edition of the Systema Natur&aelig;, knew <i>two</i>
species only of the genus <i>Caprimulgus</i>. Gmelin, in the edition of the same
work, edited by him, and published in 1788, extended the list to <i>fifteen</i>
species, and was, when Professor Barton wrote, in 1799, recent and high
authority. So greatly has the knowledge of species of birds been extended,
that at this time (1855) there are at least ninety known birds of the family
<i>Caprimulgid&aelig;</i>, all of which would have been regarded by Linn&aelig;us and
Gmelin as belonging to the genus <i>Caprimulgus</i>. There are seventy-four
species of this family in the collection of the Philadelphia Academy. Though,
as Professor Barton observes, all of those known to Gmelin (except <i>Caprimulgus
europ&aelig;us</i>), are American, others are now ascertained to inhabit all
the temperate and tropical regions of both of the great divisions of the globe,
and the whole of Australia.</p>
<p>Of this family of birds, the only species that have been ascertained or supposed
by naturalists to inhabit that part of North America within our limits,
are given in the preceding pages. The group is, however, represented in
South America not only by other species of the genera above given, but by
various other genera and species, amongst which are some curious and interesting
forms. The genus <i>Steatornis</i>, containing a single species, first brought
to notice by the celebrated Humboldt (<i>Steatornis caripensis</i>, Humboldt), is
remarkable for its near approach to the Owls, and would, to a casual observer,
scarcely be regarded as belonging to any other than that family. The genus
<i>Nyctibius</i>, which is also South American, contains some species as large as
the Crow of the United States, and which are amongst the largest birds of
this group. Another genus, <i>Hydropsalis</i>, or the Scissors-tailed Goatsuckers,
as they are termed by Azara (an enthusiastic and accurate Spanish writer on
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">242</span>
South American Natural History), are remarkable for having tails of singular
forms, and of great length in some species. <i>Hydropsalis torquatus</i> has the
two outermost feathers of its tail long, and the two middle feathers also long,
leaving the intermediate comparatively short. <i>Hydropsalis lyra</i>, Bonaparte,
has the outermost feathers of the tail very long, and curved inwards at their
ends. Two species, first described by us, <i>Hydropsalis limbatus</i> and <i>segmentatus</i>
(in Proc. Acad., Philadelphia), have that appendage several times the
length of their bodies.</p>
<p>About thirty-five species of <i>Caprimulgid&aelig;</i> inhabit South and Central
America and Mexico. The largest birds of this group are natives of Australia.</p>
<p>We are inclined to the opinion that this family (and the Swallows also)
properly belong to the circle of rapacious birds in which they have been
arranged by Prof. Reichenbach, in Avium Systema Naturale (Dresden and
Leipsic, 1850).<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
<h3 id="c130">II. FAMILY HIRUNDINID&AElig;. THE SWALLOWS.</h3>
<p>Plumage compact; size generally small; bill small, much depressed, very
wide at base, and suddenly compressed to the tip, giving it a somewhat
triangular shape; wings long; tail various, frequently forked; legs and feet
short and weak.</p>
<p>These birds form a peculiar and easily-recognized family, species of which
inhabit all parts of the world, and in civilized countries are generally regarded
with favor. The Swallows are eminently social and gregarious, being almost
constantly seen in companies even in the breeding season, and are amongst
the comparatively few birds whose numbers are not diminished by the progress
of the settlement and cultivation of countries. They subsist exclusively on
insects captured on the wing, in the pursuit of which they exhibit extraordinary
powers of flight.</p>

<p>In mature plumage, a beautiful species. This bird is common throughout
the eastern United States, and comes with much punctuality in the spring to
take possession of the boxes prepared for its accommodation in the rural districts,
and occasionally in the cities. Our esteemed friend, Mr. Thomas
Fisher, an eminent mathematician of this city, has been annually visited by
a colony of this species for several years, though his residence is in one of the
most dense parts of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>This bird is nearly allied to several species of South America and the
West Indies. In fact, the genus <i>Progne</i> is one of the most difficult of the
family of Swallows.</p>

<p>This species, long known as a bird of South America, was first ascertained
to be entitled to a place in the ornithological fauna of the United States by
Mr. John G. Bell, of New York, who noticed it in California, and previously
at Panama. We have since seen specimens from various parts of California,
and suspect that it is abundant in that and probably in other countries of
Western America.</p>
<p>Though closely related to other South American species, the present bird
may be distinguished very easily from the Purple Martin of the United States
(<i>P. purpurea</i>), by the greater width and much greater length of the bill, and
it is smaller in size. We are not confident that we have ever seen the perfectly
plumaged adults of this bird, though the specimens above described
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">247</span>
were obtained by Mr. Bell in the spring, and have the general appearance
of maturity, except that the lustre of the plumage is but faint. Little or
nothing is known of its habits or history.</p>

<p>Frequently met with, and remarkable for constructing its nest in a hole
in the ground, usually by the side of a quarry or stream of water. This
is one of the few American birds that appear to be absolutely identical with
European species. On close comparison, we can discover no characters
in the present sufficient to raise a probability of specific distinction.</p>

<p>This remarkable species is easily distinguished from any other North
American Swallow by the recurved and stiff bristles of the outer edges of the
first primary quills. There is a South American species which has, however,
the same character (<i>Cotyle flavigastra</i>).</p>
<p>The present bird considerably resembles that immediately preceding, but is
larger, and is quite distinct. It was regarded as a rare southern species,
until demonstrated by Professor Spencer F. Baird, then of Dickinson College,
Carlisle, Pennsylvania, to be of frequent occurrence in the interior of that
State. Dr. Heermann states that it is not uncommon in California. Ornithologists
generally, however, have not noticed it, and in the vicinity of
Philadelphia, it has been entirely overlooked, or does not inhabit this
district.</p>

<p>Only noticed, as yet, by the two naturalists just mentioned. This is a
handsome bird, and an interesting addition to the ornithology of the United
States, being the first species of the genus <i>Cypselus</i> discovered within our

frequents the crevices in rocks, in which it builds its nest and rears its young.
Its flight is represented to be exceedingly rapid and long-continued.</p>

sustaining protracted and rapid flight, perhaps not equalled by any other bird

color, the last darkest; rump dirty white; tail forked, each feather round at
the end; legs dusky. Inhabits Aoonalashka.&rdquo; Gm., Syn. II. p. 571.</p>
<p>This species is unknown to ornithologists of the present day, and from the
above description and the evident similarity of the bird to other small species
of this family, would not be recognized without difficulty, unless obtained in
the locality as given. It appears to belong to the genus <i>Collocalia</i>, Gray, a
very remarkable group of small Swallows, that inhabit caves, and are found
in several islands in the Pacific Ocean. A species of this genus is the Esculent
Swallow of authors (<i>Collocalia esculenta</i>), the nests of which are so highly
esteemed as an article of food by the Chinese, and are the principal constituent
in the somewhat celebrated &ldquo;Bird&rsquo;s-nest soup,&rdquo; a prominent feature in
Chinese entertainments. It is probable, too, that the nests of other species
of these birds are used for the same purpose.</p>
<p>No species of the genus alluded to has been discovered on the continent of
America, nor in either of the American islands, except the above.</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>2. <span class="sc">Hirundo phenicephala.</span> Rafinesque, Annals of Nature, p. 4. (Lexington, Kentucky, 1820.)</dt></dl>
<p>&ldquo;Head scarlet; back grey; belly white; bill and feet black. A fine and
rare Swallow, seen only once by Mr. Audubon, near Hendersonville, in Kentucky;
it must have been a wanderer, and is probably a native of Louisiana
or Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Head scarlet&rdquo;&mdash;enough said; Professor Rafinesque brings our ornithological
ideas to a stand immediately. We never heard of a Swallow with the
head of that color, exactly. But as Mr. Audubon&rsquo;s name is brought in as
authority, we think it possible that the bird alluded to in this description may
have been a straggling specimen of a South American species, which has the
head of a rufous color (<i>Cortyle fucata</i>, Temm., Pl. Col. 161, fig. 1). Rafinesque
apparently gave his description and name without ever having seen
the bird, or made further inquiry, and probably misunderstood or partly
forgot the statement of Mr. Audubon respecting the color of the head.</p>
<p>Several instances of South American birds having been captured in the
United States have come to our knowledge. We ought to have said, though,
previously, that many more South American birds inhabit Mexico than are
recorded in the books. Several specimens of <i>Crotophaga sulcirostra</i> have
come under our notice, the last one of which was shot on an island in the
Delaware, opposite to the northern portion of this city. Its plumage was
perfectly mature and uninjured, showing evidently that it had never been
caged.</p>

<p>This name also occurs in Mr. Ord&rsquo;s Catalogue, cited above. <i>Hirundo
rupestris</i>, Scopoli, inhabits Europe and Asia, but we have never been informed
of its appearance in America. It is a <i>Cotyle</i>.</p>
<p>We have now given all the species of Swallows known or supposed to
inhabit the continent of America, north of Mexico.</p>
<p>As stated in a preceding page, Swallows are found in all countries
except the Arctic regions, and are, so far as known to naturalists, birds of
very considerable similarity of habits and of general characters. The various
groups usually regarded as sub-families and genera are perhaps as easily distinguished
in this family as in any other of the entire class of Birds, and it is
one in which it is remarkable that almost every country produces species
which belong to the genus (<i>Hirundo</i>) which is the type and apparently primary
form of the family, besides forms peculiarly its own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>The types of great groups apparently more pre-eminently characterize
the ornithology of Europe than that of any other division of the globe. In
other words, Europe appears to produce the greatest number of species of
birds exhibiting the fullest development of the especial characters of the
groups to which they belong. It is very remarkable, too, that species are
found almost throughout the world slightly aberrating, as it were, from European
forms, or as though a typical form was produced with a greater or less
degree of imperfection. Of this description of birds, the various species
nearly allied to the House Swallow of Europe (<i>Hirundo rustica</i>), are a
striking illustration. The American <i>Hirundo rufa</i>, and several Asiatic and
African species, are only distinguished from that bird by characters of inferior
value in specific identification. Australia, too, produces species, which,
though apparently farther removed, are still similar. There are many other
European birds which appear to occupy the same relative positions. The
Goatsucker, Raven, Crow, Jay, and Peregrine Falcon, are instances. Of the
European Conisostral birds, nearly every species has nearly allied forms in
other regions.</p>
<p>In connection, however, with this subject, there are two considerations by
no means to be lost sight of: Firstly, the extent to which the entire science
of ornithology may be regarded as having been derived from European birds;
those having been studied, and ornithological science being in some measure an
induction from them by the fathers and founders of this branch of Zoology.
Secondly, whether in reality the production of the higher developments in
birds is not peculiar to the western portions of the two great hemispheres, at
least in the northern regions of these divisions of the globe. We regard it
as evidently the case in the Old World, and not less so in America. That the
ornithology of western North America produces the highest developments of
forms in this class of animals that are to be found on this continent, we think
fully demonstrable. But at present we regard it as true that Europe produces
marked ornithological types of divisions strictly natural.</p>
<p>There are about one hundred known species of Swallows, of which eighty-five
are in the collection of the Philadelphia Academy. The South American
birds of this family, for the greater part, belong to genera represented in
North America. Of the genus <i>Progne</i> there are several species peculiar to
that portion of this continent, several of which possess habits and manners
very similar to those of the Purple Martin. The same may be said of several
species of <i>Acanthylis</i>, two or three of which considerably resemble our Chimney
Bird. Of the Bank Swallows (<i>Cotyle</i>), there are also several South
American species.</p>

<p>This handsome little King-Fisher, though well known as a bird of South
America, has, within the limits of the United States, only been observed on
the Rio Grande in Texas. Several naturalists, however, mention having
heard of a small species of King-Fisher in Southern California, and it is
probable that the present bird will yet be found inhabiting that State.</p>
<p>This bird may very readily be distinguished from the common species of
the United States by its small size and different colors; but there are other
South American species of the same genus which it resembles. There is a
group of these birds, the species of which, in fact, bear so great similarity to
each other in form and in colors also, that they can be distinguished specifically
mainly by their size. This group embraces <i>Ceryle amazona</i>, <i>inda</i>,
<i>superciliosa</i>, <i>Cabanisii</i>, and the bird now before us. The first is as large as
our Belted King-Fisher (<i>Ceryle alcyon</i>), and has been found in Mexico. All
of these species are colored very much like the present bird, though, as above
intimated, presenting marked difference in size.</p>
<p>The King-Fishers are most abundant in the southern regions of the world,
and the preceding two species are all that have ever been noticed within the
limits of the United States, though several others inhabit Mexico. Two
<span class="pb" id="Page_256">256</span>
species also are known as birds of Europe, though one of them (<i>Ceryle rudis</i>),
like our second species in the United States, is a visitor only in the southern
countries of that division of the globe.</p>
<p>In Asia and the Asiatic islands, and in Australia, numerous species of
these birds are found. Some of the Australian species are the largest of this
family, being of the size of or larger than the Crow of the United States,
and are remarkable for their loud and discordant voices. They belong to the
genus <i>Dacelo</i> of naturalists. Great diversity of size occurs in this family.
There are other species (of the genera <i>Ispidina</i> and <i>Ceyx</i>), which are not
larger than the Chipping Sparrow of this country, though, to all intents and
purposes, regularly established King-Fishers, and probably preying on fishes
of a size accordingly.</p>
<p>Though many of the birds of this family are partially aquatic in their
habits, and subsist exclusively on fishes, there are species principally inhabiting
the islands in the Pacific, and Australia, which are stated to live habitually
in forests, subsisting on reptiles and small terrestrial animals of other
classes. These birds belong to the genera <i>Todiramphus</i> and <i>Dacelo</i> of
authors.</p>
<p>Naturalists enumerate about ninety species of King-Fishers, of which
specimens of seventy-seven are in the collection of the Philadelphia Academy.</p>
<p>We find recorded no species of King-Fishers to be considered as doubtful
or obscure birds of that portion of North America within our prescribed
limits.</p>
<p>With this family we close that division of the Perching Birds classed by
ornithologists as <i>Fissirostres</i>. Two other families, the <i>Trogonid&aelig;</i> and the
<i>Meropid&aelig;</i>, are not represented by species inhabiting the United States or the
more northern countries of this continent. Of the <i>Trogonid&aelig;</i>, however,
several species are found in Mexico, one of which (<i>Trogon mexicanus</i>) was
observed by Lieut. Couch, in the northern part of that country, and will very
probably yet be found within the present limits of this confederacy. All the
American <i>Trogons</i> are birds of remarkable beauty, and one of them (<i>Calurus
resplendens</i>) can scarcely be surpassed in any country. It inhabits Central
America, and is the sacred bird of the aborigines, and mentioned by Mr.
Stephens and other travellers in the countries which it inhabits. Its plumage,
and that of many other American species, is of fine metallic golden green
and scarlet.</p>
<p>Of the <i>Meropid&aelig;</i>, or Bee-eaters, no species inhabits America. Those birds
are almost restricted to Asia and Africa, one species only being European.</p>

<br />Baird&rsquo;s Buzzard.
<br />PLATE XLI. Adults?</h2>
<p>Of the several new species of rapacious birds of North America, which
have been discovered within a few years, the bird now before the reader is
one of the most interesting. It is the second species now ascertained to
inhabit this continent, of a group constituting the typical genus <i>Buteo</i> of
naturalists, which until a recent period was supposed to be peculiar to the
Old World, the previously known American species being Swainson&rsquo;s Buzzard
(<i>Buteo Swainsonii</i>), a bird of the northern regions, little known and nearly
lost sight of until recently by ornithologists.</p>
<p>The birds of this group are more active and Falcon-like in their habits
than the other species of the North American Buzzards, all of which have been
classified in other sub-genera. They also appear to be more strictly predatory
in their habits.</p>
<p>The present species was discovered by P. R. Hoy, M. D., an active and
enthusiastic naturalist of Racine, Wisconsin, who first observed it and
obtained specimens in the vicinity of that city. In the same State, it has
also been observed by the Rev. A. O. Barry, of Racine, and Mr. William
Dudley, of Madison, both naturalists of extensive acquirements, who have
done much to elucidate the zoology of that district. All of those gentlemen
concur, however, in representing it as very probably a visitor only in Wisconsin,
and migrating to more northern regions of the continent of America.
In addition to their specimens, we have seen one other only, which is contained
in a collection now deposited in the National Museum, Washington,
and was obtained near the Great Salt Lake, Utah Territory, by Lieut. E. G.
Beckwith, of the United States Army, in whose charge a party surveyed one
of the proposed routes for a Railroad to the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>We have to express our obligations to Dr. Hoy for his kindness in furnishing
the following notice of this bird for our present article:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although never numerous, this fine Hawk is not unfrequently met with
during the fall and spring, especially in the vicinity of Racine, but is exceedingly
wary and difficult to approach, and as it is here an inhabitant almost
exclusively of the prairies, the procuring of specimens even by an experienced
hunter or collector, is almost entirely dependant on encountering it
accidentally within gunshot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bird may be readily known, though seen at a considerable distance or
heighth in the air, by its long pointed wings and rapid flight; in the last
respect somewhat resembling the Duck Hawk (<i>Falco anatum</i>), and in fact
<span class="pb" id="Page_258">258</span>
looking somewhat like that species when on the wing. I witnessed not long
since, a bird of this species flying rapidly, but he wheeled about suddenly and
struck into a covey of Partridges with wonderful celerity of movement, and
bore off in his talons sufficient evidence that his exploit had been fully successful.
This bird possesses much greater activity of habits than any other
of our Hawks of the same genus (<i>Buteo</i>), and its mode of flight is quite
different.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The favorite haunts of this species are the broad prairies, over which it may
be seen generally flying or coursing around in quest of its prey, or occasionally
perched in repose, but very carefully keeping out of the range of the
gun. It is one of the most shy of our Hawks, and I have never known an
instance of its visiting the vicinity of the farm-house, or disturbing the domestic
poultry, as is done by nearly all other of our birds of the Falcon kind,
much to the disadvantage of their reputation with our farmers and housewives.
The present bird at least saves his character in that respect, for he
never comes near, and prefers also that no one shall come near him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prey of this species is principally Grouse, Quails, and other birds;
but when opportunity offers, he does not disdain field-mice, or even snakes.
The Pinnated Grouse, or Prairie Hen, as it is universally called in our region
of country (<i>Tetrao cupido</i>), is his most common food, which, frequenting the
prairies habitually, his pursuit of this bird is the cause of his being so constantly
seen in such localities. Usually he has little difficulty in procuring a
supply sufficient for his wants. I am under the impression that this bird
does not rear its young in this part of Wisconsin, as I have never known its
nest to be found, though I have of various other species. I have never seen
this bird soar in the manner of other Buzzards. It is apparently a visitor
only to this part of the State of Wisconsin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The specimens obtained by Dr. Hoy, one of which is represented in the
upper figure in our plate, present considerable similarity in colors; but we
have seen one other, which had the colors much darker, and the under-parts
especially much marked with black. The latter specimen is represented in
our lower figure, and was obtained in the neighborhood of Madison, Wisconsin,
by Mr. William Dudley, Secretary of the Wisconsin Natural History
Society. The specimen from Utah Territory is almost precisely identical
in color with those obtained by Dr. Hoy.</p>
<p>We have no further information respecting this interesting species.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Obs.</span> This bird does not intimately resemble any other of the American
Falconid&aelig; at present known, and is a well marked species, especially in the
plumage above described as probably the younger. In this the nearly uniform
brownish black breast and large spots of the same color on the other

above bears some resemblance to the young of <i>Buteo lineatus</i>, and also to the

<p>To us it is a point of high interest that the present bird bears the name
of one with whom our relations have been intimate and of the most pleasant
character almost since boyhood. One who is a most competent and efficient
officer of the first Institution in America for the diffusion of knowledge&mdash;one
who has gained a rank amongst the first American zoologists; and better, no

<br />The Curved-billed Thrush.
<br />PLATE XLII. Adult Male.</h2>
<p>The bird now before the reader is one of the most admired songsters of the
western countries of North America. By competent judges, as we shall see
in the course of the present article, he has been pronounced worthy of favorable
mention, even when compared with our great sylvan vocalists, the Mocking
Bird, and the Rufous Thrush, to both of which he can claim relationship,
not distant.</p>
<p>Viewed as the representatives of principles embodied, as it were, in the
various forms or rather classes of animal life, a consideration by no means to
be overlooked in the present age of zoological science, birds are the especial
exponents of the principles of the beautiful, and, of all classes of animals,
appeal most directly to the higher faculties of the human mind. Entire symmetry
and elegance of form, gracefulness of motion, agreeable and varied
colors, and the fact that of the vast circle of animal life, they alone possess
vocal powers which are musical, have recommended this class, and tended to
perpetuate its high estimation in all civilized countries.</p>
<p>The flight of birds, never yet successfully imitated by the ingenuity of man
(unlike in that respect the motions of fishes in their element), is a means of
locomotion so entirely peculiar as always to have attracted attention, and, in
past ages, wonder, even to such extent as to have assumed an aspect of superstition,
not entirely ignorant nor reprehensible, because founded on facts of
nature, manifesting itself in auguries and divinations, which commanded
respect for centuries erroneously, but expanded into truth at last by the aid
of the light of Inductive science. The conclusions of the learned and cultivated
nations of antiquity, however apparently erroneous, are rarely without
some foundation in and relation to truth, and in many cases are the origin of
modern science. So the augurs were the first ornithologists, as the astrologers
were the first astronomers.</p>
<p>The poets have found in birds the most attractive of animals. There is
scarcely one from the great Grecian era of taste and poetry to the present
day, in whose productions passages do not occur, recognised as beautiful and
deriving their essential character from this class of objects. Hebrew and
Greek were alike in this respect, whether in the derivation of sacred symbols
or of imagery in poetic allusion; the Dove of the former is of the same
general character as the Peacock of Juno, or the Sparrows of Venus, poetic
and truthful to nature and of the same origin. The Greek poets found in
birds suitable accompaniments for the most sublime creations of their genius,
their Deities. The greatest of Hebrew poets rejoices in the assurance that
&ldquo;the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the Turtle is heard
in the land.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>Singing birds belong exclusively to the class of Insessores or Perching
birds. One Falcon only (an African species, <i>Falco musicus</i>), is said to possess
a musical voice, not making, though we much suspect, any considerable
figure in that line. No wading, swimming, or gallinaceous bird makes any
pretensions.</p>
<p>The song was long considered as entirely the expression of love during the
season, which has its most pleasant analogy in the spring-time of life, but that
conclusion admits of some exceptions. Many birds sing in autumn apparently
without the pleasant incitement of either actual or prospective attachment.
Cases occur, too, as we have sometimes witnessed, of a bird having, to all
appearance, failed in securing the object of his choice, remaining alone and
solacing himself with a song occasionally for the balance of the season;&mdash;possibly
somewhat of the nature of deriving comfort from &ldquo;ends of verse and
sayings of philosophers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our present bird belongs to the family of Thrushes, but to a genus
which can scarcely be said to be represented in the States on the Atlantic;
though the Rufous Thrush (<i>Mimus rufus</i>) is very nearly related to it, if not
actually belonging to the group. This bird has been observed by nearly all
the naturalists who have visited western North America, and its history is
comparatively well known. To our friend, Col. McCall, we have to acknowledge
our obligations, as on many former occasions, for a contribution intended
for our present article:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This remarkable bird, whose dulcet notes, flowing with exquisite smoothness,
place him almost beyond rivalry among the countless songsters that
enliven the woods of America, or indeed of the world at large, is as retired
and simple in his manners as he is gay and brilliant in song. In his ordinary
hearing, as well as in the very marked character of his flight, he exhibits a
strong resemblance to our humble and unobtrusive, though always welcome
vocalist, the Ferruginous Thrush (<i>M. rufus</i>); while in the faculty of modulating
sweet sounds he is scarcely surpassed by the dashing, ambitious, and
ever-animated Mocking Bird (<i>M. polyglottus</i>). His resemblance to the Ferruginous
Thrush in the particulars above mentioned, forcibly impressed itself
upon me the first time I saw the California bird. This was on the banks of
the Rio Colorado, below the mouth of the Gila, where, in the month of June,
the shade and seclusion afforded by the cotton-wood and the willow seemed to
be a favorite abode of the species. I saw many individuals in the course of a
ride of fifteen miles through this wild region. In one quiet nook I met with
a pair &lsquo;in love and mutual honors joined,&rsquo; who evidently had some dear little
&lsquo;pledges of peace&rsquo; secreted in the dense foliage around. They were greatly
excited by my approach, deprecating the unlooked-for intrusion with abundant
<span class="pb" id="Page_262">262</span>
energy and vehemence. It was then that their harsh, scolding notes, their
motions, and all their attitudes, reminded me most forcibly of my old friends
of the Atlantic groves, although, under other circumstances, the resemblance
was sufficiently obvious. But, besides their traits of character, there is a
striking resemblance in the organization of the two species; the bill, for
instance of <i>M. rufus</i>, when compared with the bills of its congeners, <i>M. polyglottus</i>,
<i>M. carolinensis</i>, and others, is found to be greatly elongated and
much curved, and in this lengthened and curved bill (to say nothing of the
shorter wings and longer tail) may easily be discerned a decided approach to
the remarkable form developed in <i>T. rediviva</i>, and other closely allied species.
This coincidence of a similarity of organization with a similarity of manners
is, I think, sufficiently marked to show a close relationship between the two
species; or, in other words, to indicate <i>M. rufus</i> as the connecting link
between these two distinct genera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The song of the California bird is far superior to that of the Thrush,&mdash;though
it must be admitted that he has not the powerful voice of our Mocking
bird, that prince of songsters, nor his imitative powers; but he certainly has
a liquid mellowness of tone united with clearness of expression and volubility
of utterance that cannot be surpassed. On the first occasion on which it was
my good fortune to hear this bird fairly tune his pipes to sound a roundelay,
the performer was perched upon the bare branch of an ancient oak, and his
farewell carol to the departing day was delivered with a warmth and pathos
so truly wonderful as to fill me with admiration and delight; and though I
was then anxious to procure birds for the Museum of the Philadelphia
Academy, I scarcely thought of molesting him whose vesper chaunt had just
enlivened that wild, secluded vale! I cannot, even now, without a tweak of
contrition and self-reproach, acknowledge that the desire to procure a &lsquo;specimen&rsquo;
prompted me, some time afterwards, to shoot a bird of this species.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This almost sacrilegious act, I feel bound to confess, met with a just
reward; for, having placed my prize on the branch of a neighboring tree, in
order to preserve its plumage unruffled, while I continued my pursuit after
game (for the larder as well as for the cabinet) I had the mortification, on my
return, to find that some savage wild animal, as little impressed by soul-stirring
music, I might almost say, as myself, had made a hasty supper off
my divine songster, feathers and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Heermann, in his manuscript notes, through his kindness now in our
possession, thus mentions the present bird:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bird is abundant. I have not only seen it in Northern California,
but also as far south as Texas, on the borders of the Rio Grande. It is shy
and retiring in its habits, and when startled, flies low for some distance, and
plunging into a thicket, alights on the ground, and so conceals itself, that it
is not again easily found. It runs or hops on the ground with considerable
facility and speed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>&ldquo;Among the feathered songsters of Western America, this bird is the most
superior, and its song is a striking feature in the localities where it is found.
Its notes are equal in harmony to those of the Mocking bird of the United
States, though not so varied. To the miners it is well known by the name
of the California Mocking bird, and it is with them a great favorite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It incubates in California, but the only nest that I ever found contained
young in the month of July. This nest was composed of coarse twigs and
lined with slender roots, not very carefully constructed, and resembling somewhat
those of some other of the Thrushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Henry has also observed this bird in the vicinity of Fort Fillmore,
rather abundantly, particularly during the months of October and November.
It has been noticed, too, by nearly all the other naturalists who have visited
California and New Mexico.</p>
<p>The figure in our plate is rather less than half the size of life.</p>
<p>The plant represented is a species of <i>Vernonia</i>, from the neighbourhood
of Santa F&eacute;, New Mexico, and was raised from the seed by Mr. Robert
Kilvington, of this city.</p>

characters.</p>
<p>Dr. Gambel regarded this bird as identical with a species mentioned and

(Paris, 1797), under the name of &ldquo;Promerops de la California Septentrionale.&rdquo;

name, <i>redivivus</i>.</p>
<p>Whether it is the fact, however, that the figure in La Peyrouse represents
the present bird, admits of some doubt. To us it is much more like <i>Toxostoma
curvirostris</i>, a smaller species.</p>

<br />The Vermilion Flycatcher.
<br />PLATE XLIII. Males.</h2>
<p>Of this brilliant-plumaged little Flycatcher, we have, we regret to say,
but little information. It has been known as a Mexican bird since 1827,
when specimens were sent to Europe for the first time by Mr. William
Bullock, a Fellow of the Linn&aelig;an Society of London, who was then resident
in Mexico, but has as yet been obtained once only within the limits of the
United States. It was received in a collection made in Texas, and containing
many interesting species, by Mr. J. P. Giraud, an accomplished and
active ornithologist of the city of New York, and was by him first introduced
as entitled to a place in the ornithological fauna of this country. Since that
period no one of the several American naturalists who have visited Texas,
has had the good fortune to meet with it.</p>
<p>This bird was first described by Mr. Swainson, in the Philosophical Magazine,
new series, I. p. 367, but little or nothing more is said of it than on the
authority of Mr. Bullock, it is stated to be an inhabitant of the table lands,
and that the specimens in his collection were obtained in the vicinity of
Valladolid. Mr. Bullock himself, in his interesting book, &ldquo;Six Months in
Mexico,&rdquo; does not allude to it.</p>
<p>Nor is there, in a more elaborate paper, in which this bird is described by
the Baron de la Fresnaye, in Guerin&rsquo;s Magazine of Zoology (as cited below),
a much more explicit or satisfactory history. Its habits, it is stated, resemble
those of the Tits (Genus <i>Parus</i>), and it has a feeble cry like the syllables
<i>pe-pe-pe</i>. Mons. de la Fresnaye&rsquo;s specimens were from Jalapa, and were
killed in August.</p>
<p>This bird belongs to a group of Flycatchers of small size, of which various
species inhabit the warmer parts of America, and are represented in the North
only by the Redstart (<i>Setophagha ruticilla</i>), a common and well known bird
of the United States. Nearly all the species are remarkable for the gay and
showy colors of their plumage; but the bird now before us is certainly entitled
to precedence on such foundation for pretensions. It is not equalled by
any other species of its group, and is in fact one of the most beautiful of the
smaller birds of North America.</p>
<p>Our figures, which represent adult males, are about two-thirds of the size
of life, and were drawn from specimens obtained in Mexico, now in the
collection of the Philadelphia Academy.</p>

<br />PLATE XLIV. Adult Male.</h2>
<p>This bird is the only one yet discovered in the United States, of a family
of Gallinaceous Birds, of which numerous species are found in the warmer
countries of America. Various species inhabit Mexico and Central America,
some of which, including that now before us, appear to be readily domesticated,
and in Mexico especially, may frequently be seen amongst the usual
feathered denizens of the farm-yard.</p>
<p>The birds of this group, known by the names of Guans, Curassow birds, and
Mexican Turkeys, and the Turkeys proper, are two families of the Gallinaceous
birds that are peculiarly American, and not distantly related to each
other. Of the Turkeys, two species are known, the most numerous of which
is the Wild Turkey of North America. The other, even more handsome in
its plumage than the former, has as yet only been found in Central America,
and is known as the Honduras Turkey. It is by no means well established
that the Domestic Turkey is descended from the wild species of North America.
Its origin probably has not yet been discovered.</p>
<p>The family to which our present species belongs (<i>Cracid&aelig;</i>), contains birds
that for the greater part live in the forests, and are remarkable for habitually
frequenting trees to a much greater extent than is usual amongst the
larger Gallinaceous birds, and constructing their nests in the branches much
in the same style as the smaller perching birds. Several species, amongst
which is the bird now before us, have very loud and discordant voices.</p>
<p>The Curassow Birds (Genus <i>Crax</i>) are the best known of this family.
They are generally of black or dark red plumage, more or less varied with
white, and have very curious and handsome crests, of stiff, recurved feathers.
These birds are frequently domesticated in Mexico and the other countries
that they inhabit, and a species or two are contained in almost every menagerie
of any considerable pretensions in the United States.</p>
<p>The species now before us was first noticed as a bird of the United States,
by Col. McCall, who observed it in Texas. Since that period, it has been
repeatedly obtained by American naturalists either in that country or in New
Mexico.</p>
<p>With that ability and courtesy which has added so much to the interest
of the present volume, Col. McCall has furnished the following for our
article on this interesting bird:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>&ldquo;This very gallant-looking and spirited bird I saw, for the first time within
our territory, in the extensive forest of <i>chaparral</i> which envelopes the <i>Resaca
de la Palma</i>, a stream rendered famous in the history of our country by the
victory achieved by the American forces under Gen. Taylor. Here, and for
miles along the lower Rio Grande, the <i>poliocephala</i> was abundant; and
throughout this region, the remarkable and sonorous cry of the male bird
could not fail to attract and fix the attention of the most obtuse or listless
wanderer who might chance to approach its abode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the Mexicans it is called <i>Chiac-chia-lacca</i>, an Indian name, and
doubtlessly derived from the peculiar cry of the bird, which strikingly resembles
a repetition of those syllables. And when I assure you that its voice in
compass is equal to that of the Guinea-fowl, and in harshness but little inferior,
you may form some idea of the chorus with which the forest is made to
ring at the hour of sunrise. At that hour, in the month of April, I have
observed a proud and stately fellow descend from the tree on which he had
roosted, and mounting upon an old log or stump, commence his clear shrill
cry. This was soon responded to, in a lower tone, by the female, the latter
always taking up the strain as soon as the importunate call of her mate had
ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus alternating, one pair after another would join in the matinal chorus,
and before the rising sun had fairly lighted up their close retreat, the woods
would ring with the din of an hundred voices, as the happy couples met after
the period of separation and repose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When at length all this clatter had terminated, the parties quietly betook
themselves to their morning-meal. If surprised while thus employed, they
would fly into the trees above, whence, peering down with stretched necks
and heads turned sideways to the ground, they would challenge the intruder
with a singular and oft-repeated croaking note, of which it would be difficult
to give any adequate idea with words alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, the volubility and singularity of voice of the <i>poliocephala</i> is
perhaps its most striking and remarkable trait&mdash;at least, it so appeared to me.
In illustration of which I will state that, while on the march from Matamoras
to Tampico, we had encamped on the 30th December, at the spring of
<i>Encinal</i>, whence, a short time before sunset, I rode out in company with an
officer in search of game. We were passing through a woodland near the
stream, when our ears were saluted with a strange sound that resembled
somewhat the cry of the panther (<i>Felis onca</i>). We stopped our horses and
listened&mdash;the cry was repeated, and we were completely at a loss to what
animal to ascribe it. I dismounted, and having crawled cautiously through
the thicket for some distance, came upon an opening where there were some
larger trees; from the lower branches of one of which I now ascertained that
the sound proceeded. In a moment or two I discovered a large male <i>poliocephala</i>
ascending towards the top of the tree, and uttering this hitherto
<span class="pb" id="Page_269">269</span>
unheard sound as he sprang from branch to branch in mounting to his roost.
He seemed to be much occupied with his own thoughts, and did not observe
me; and therefore I was enabled to watch his movements. In a few moments
his call was answered from a distance, and soon afterwards he was joined by
a bird of the year. Others followed, coming in from different quarters; and
there were, in a little while, five or six of them upon the tree. One of these
now discovered me, and the alarm was given. The singular cry of the old
bird ceased, and they all began to exhibit uneasiness and a disposition to fly;
whereupon I shot the old bird, as I had resolved to secure him at all events.
On rejoining my companion, he could not at first believe me to be serious,
when I told him the sound we had heard had proceeded from the old cock
that I presented to him, and who had been calling his family together at the
close of day in the manner I have described. On my return to camp, I
entered in my note-book the following description which I took from this
bird:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Length 23 inches, 6 lines; alar stretch, 26 inches; tail, 11 inches; tarsus,
2 inches, 7 lines. The bill similar to that of the common fowl, but longer on
the ridge and more curved at the point; the upper mandible light slate blue,
the lower yellowish, but brown near the base; legs and feet blackish slate
color; the nails black; the irides dark hazel; the chin devoid of feathers,
and its skin, which is of an orange-red color, approximating in looseness to
the gills of the common fowl; general color above, a brownish olive, with
dark green reflections, deepest on the head; breast and belly light rufous,
with whitish longitudinal pencillings; tail (of twelve feathers) darker than
the back, and with a broad terminal band of dull white; wings dusky olive.
A male; a very fine specimen, killed near Encinal, Dec. 30, 1846.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A remarkable feature in the <i>poliocephala</i> is the eye, which in the living
bird is full of courage and animation&mdash;it is equal, in fact, in brilliancy to that
of the finest game cock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I frequently noticed this bird domesticated by the Mexicans at Matamoras,
Monterey, &amp;c., and going at large about their gardens. I was assured
that in this condition it not unfrequently crossed with the common fowl; but
I did not see the progeny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the wild state, the eggs are from six to eight, never exceeding the
last number. They are white, without spots; and rather smaller than a
pullet&rsquo;s egg. The nest is usually made on the ground, at the root of a large
tree, or at the side of an old log, where a hole several inches deep is scratched
in the ground; this is lined with leaves, and the eggs are always carefully
covered with the same when the female leaves them for the purpose of feeding.
If disturbed while on her nest, she flies at the intruder with all the
spirit and determination of the common domestic hen, whose retreat has been
invaded.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>This species has been noticed by several of the naturalists who have
recently made such important contributions to the ornithology of the southwestern
frontier of the United States. Specimens brought by Mr. John H.
Clark, were obtained near Ringgold Barracks, Texas. The fine collection
made in Texas and Mexico, by Lieut. D. N. Couch, of the United States
Army, contained specimens obtained in the State of New Leon, in the latter
country.</p>

<h2 id="c145"><span class="small">BERNICLA LEUCOPAREIA.&mdash;(Brandt.)</span>
<br />The White-necked Goose.
<br />PLATE XLV. Adult Male.</h2>
<p>On the western coast of North America, this is one of the most abundant
of the species of Geese. In California it appears regularly in the course of
its migrations in the spring and autumn, and at both seasons is brought to
the market in San Francisco, in large numbers.</p>
<p>This bird is a near relative of Hutchins&rsquo; Goose, a well known species,
though not of common occurrence on the Atlantic coast. It is more frequently
met with in the larger rivers of the interior. From that species our
present bird may be easily distinguished by the white ring around the neck,
a character not mentioned in the descriptions given by authors, nor represented
in the plate in Mr. Audubon&rsquo;s Birds of America, of Hutchins&rsquo; Goose.
The plate alluded to is the only one of the species which has come under our
notice, and is given with that eminent naturalist&rsquo;s usual great accuracy, but
may not, we suspect, represent a bird in mature plumage. This suspicion
we have been induced to entertain from an examination of the specimen
figured by Mr. Audubon, for an opportunity to make which we are indebted
to the kindness of our friend, Mr. J. P. Giraud, of New York, to whose fine
collection it belongs.</p>
<p>We are not, however, sufficiently familiar with Hutchins&rsquo; Goose, to feel
qualified to decide respecting the identity of the present species.</p>
<p>This bird was first described by Prof. Brandt, a distinguished Russian
naturalist, who ascertained it be an inhabitant of the coasts of Russian America.
This author, and various others of Russia, have done much towards
elucidating the Natural History of Northwestern America, and in some
instances names given by them will be found to anticipate those of Americans,
especially in ornithology.</p>
<p>As a species occurring on the coast of California, our present bird was
first observed by Mr. John G. Bell, of New York, whose collection made in
that country contained numerous specimens. Since that period, it has been
noticed by nearly all our naturalists, though nothing is recorded of its habits
or history. In fact, the water-birds of Western America have by no means
received sufficient attention, and contributions to their history would be
important additions to American ornithology.</p>

<h2 id="c147"><span class="small">THALASSIDROMA FURCATA.&mdash;(Gmelin.)</span>
<br />The Gray Storm Petrel.
<br />PLATE XLVI. Adults.</h2>
<p>The little birds of the group to which that now before the reader belongs,
are known to seamen, wherever the English language is spoken, as Storm
Petrels, or &ldquo;Mother Carey&rsquo;s Chickens,&rdquo; and have too, a reputation, not without
a tinge of superstition, of being the harbingers of the storm and of maritime
disaster.</p>
<p>Of the many birds adapted by their organization to a life of adventure on
the ocean or its tributaries, and of which in fact during a large portion of
their lives they are almost as much inhabitants as fishes, the Albatrosses and
the Storm Petrels, or Mother Carey&rsquo;s Chickens, venture the most boldly.
The birds of both these genera, though one contains the largest and the other
the smallest of marine birds, are alike in this particular character, and are
also alike known as inhabitants of shores very remote from each other, and
as wanderers over immense extents of the ocean.</p>
<p>Boldly directing their course far out on the sea, like their gigantic relatives
the Albatrosses, our present little birds are frequently to be met with in
nearly all latitudes usually traversed by navigators, and are generally tempted
to remain for a time in the wakes of vessels, and about them, by the fragments
of food to be gleaned from refuse thrown overboard. Flitting as it
were before the gale, with it, the appearance of these birds may readily be
coincident, or premonitory of its coming, thus acquiring, and perhaps in some
degree justly, the attributed character of precursors.</p>
<p>Several species of these birds are found on the coasts of the United States.
The most abundant and best known is Wilson&rsquo;s Storm Petrel (<i>Thalassidroma
Wilsonii</i>), a bird which is perhaps to be regarded as more nearly cosmopolite
than any other, so extensive are its wanderings over the surface of the ocean.
It is of common occurrence throughout the whole extent of the eastern shores
of the continent of America, and it has been repeatedly noticed and captured
at various points on the coasts of Europe and Africa, thus demonstrating a
range over nearly the entire Atlantic Ocean. In the Pacific also it is well
known, though it is not so abundant. Mr. Gould gives it as a bird of Australia;
and the naturalists of the United States&rsquo; Exploring Expedition in the
Vincennes and Peacock, record its appearance at various other points in the
Pacific Ocean.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>The histories of this, and of other American species of Storm Petrels, are
perhaps as well known as those of the sea-birds generally, and much that is
interesting may be found in the articles on them in the works of our predecessors
in American Ornithology; but we cannot allow the present occasion
to pass without availing ourselves of the kindness of our friend, Charles
Pickering, M. D., of Boston, one of the naturalists attached to the Exploring
Expedition, and justly ranked with the most eminent of American Zoologists.</p>
<p>With his characteristic liberality, Dr. Pickering has placed at our disposal
much valuable information relative to birds observed during the voyage of
the Expedition, especially on the western coast of North America, and in other
localities of interest, with reference to American species. From his manuscript
we copy the following in relation to Wilson&rsquo;s Petrel, which occurs under date
of October 24th, 1838, and from the latitude and longitude given, the nearest
land was the coast of Africa:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stormy Petrel taken, which proved to be <i>Thalassidroma Wilsonii</i>, and
although this species and others of its genus have been constantly seen during
the voyage of the Expedition, this is the first specimen that has been captured
without having been injured, thus affording whatever facilities can be obtained
on shipboard for observing its manners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was rather surprised to observe that this bird was not only entirely
incapable of perching, but even of standing upright like birds in general, and
as I have seen birds of this genus represented, unless by the aid of its wings.
In standing, or rather sitting, the whole of the <i>tarsus</i> (commonly mistaken
for the leg) rests on the ground, and it walks in the same awkward position,
frequently being obliged to balance itself with its wings. By a more powerful
exertion of its wings, however, it was enabled to run along on its toes in the
same manner as it does over the surface of the waves. The absence of a
hind toe, the nails being but slightly bent and flat, and perhaps I may add,
its evidently being unaccustomed to this description of locomotion, seemed to
be the causes of its helplessness on its feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These birds have been numerous about us for some days past, and their
coursing over the water with flitting wings remind me of the actions of
butterflies about a pool. One of them was seen swimming, or at least resting,
on the surface. We have seen this species very frequently, indeed almost
daily, since leaving America, and scarcely any other sea-birds, except in the
immediate vicinity of the islands. It would seem that it scarcely ever visits
the land, except for the purposes of incubation, and there can hardly be a
better comment on its untiring power of wing than the popular fable amongst
seamen that it carries its egg and hatches its young while sitting in the water.
It does not sail in the continued manner of the gulls and some other sea-birds,
but moves by rapidly flexing its wings something like a bat, and was
continually coursing around and in the wake of the vessel, generally in considerable
numbers, during much the greater part of the time that the Expedition
was in the Atlantic Ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>The curious fact that this bird cannot stand upright we do not remember
ever before having seen noticed. Of the specimen alluded to, Dr. Pickering
gives notes of a minute and evidently very careful anatomical examination,
which the limits of our present article will not allow us to insert. They are,
however, confirmatory, in most respects, of the account of the anatomy of
this species, given by Mr. Audubon, in Ornithological Biography, V., p. 645.</p>
<p>The bird before the reader in the present plate is an inhabitant of the
Northern Pacific Ocean, and is an interesting addition to the ornithological
fauna of the United States, made by the naturalists of the Exploring Expedition,
under command of Captain Charles Wilkes, to which we have previously
alluded. Though long known as a bird of the coasts of Asiatic
Russia and of Russian America, it had never before been noticed on the
more southern coast of Oregon, where it was found in large numbers by the
Expedition, and specimens then obtained are now in the National Museum at
Washington.</p>
<p>This bird was first noticed by the celebrated Pennant, in Arctic Zoology,
Vol. II., p. 255, who called it the &ldquo;Fork-tailed Petrel.&rdquo; An accurate description
is given by him, but no further account of it than merely stating
&ldquo;taken among the ice between Asia and America.&rdquo; On the faith of this
description, Gmelin, in <i>Systema Natur&aelig;</i>, as cited below, gave the scientific
name. Subsequently, Pallas mentions it as an inhabitant of the coasts of
Unalaschka and of the Kurile Islands. It is also mentioned in the Zoology
of the Voyage of the Sulphur, (London, 1844,) and very handsomely figured
from specimens obtained at Sitka in Russian America.</p>
<p>To the journal of Dr. Pickering we have again to acknowledge our obligations
for a notice of this bird. First recording its occurrence on the 26th of
April, 1840, at sea, the distance from the coast of Oregon being about 200
miles, he subsequently mentions it under date of 29th of the same month, as
follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In sight of the coast of Oregon. Great numbers of the gray <i>Thalassidroma</i>
are to-day flitting around and in the track of the vessel, very actively
engaged in searching for particles of food thrown overboard. Generally, this
bird reminds us of <i>T. Wilsonii</i>, but the wings seem longer, and its movements
appear to be more rapid, and in fact more like that of the larger Petrels,
(<i>Procellaria</i>.) It occasionally sails in its flight, but for the greater part
moves by very rapidly flexing its wings in the same manner as the species
mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These birds proved not difficult to capture, and several specimens were
taken with a hook and line. They would dive a foot or two after the bait,
and made use of their wings in and under the water, from which they apparently
had not that difficulty in rising observable in the Albatrosses. Though
their powers of swimming seemed rather feeble, they alighted in the water
without hesitation. The dead body of one of their companions being thrown
<span class="pb" id="Page_277">277</span>
overboard, they clustered around it with as much avidity as around any other
food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The specimens obtained agree generally in color of plumage, being nearly
a uniform pale gray, with the abdomen sometimes paler or nearly white, and
generally showing a lighter bar across the wing, when expanded. Uttered a
faint note when taken on board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At present we have no further information relating to this interesting
species.</p>

<br />Kirtland&rsquo;s Warbler.
<br />PLATE XLVII. Adult.</h2>
<p>Of the smaller birds of North America, no group exceeds that of the
Warblers, in variety and richness of color. It is, too, one of the largest of
the groups of our birds, embracing not less than forty species, besides several
which are South American.</p>
<p>Migrating in the spring, and again in the autumn, these little birds are
known in the Middle and Southern States, for the greater part as visitors
only, though various species are residents during the summer, which have
been supposed to continue their journey much further north, before undertaking
the duties of incubation. The Blackburnian Warbler (<i>Sylvicola
Blackburni&aelig;</i>), the Chestnut-sided (<i>S. icterocephala</i>), the Yellow-backed (<i>S.
Americana</i>), and several others, breed in the mountains of Pennsylvania.
The Prairie (<i>S. discolor</i>), the Blue-winged (<i>Helinaia solitaria</i>), and two or
three other species, are to be met with every summer in the neighborhood of
Philadelphia. The greater number of species proceed further north, but
much the majority of all known as North American rear their young within
the limits of the United States, as well as in more northern countries; but
by no means exclusively in the latter, as is to be inferred from the representations
of various authors. The Black-poll (<i>S. striata</i>), raises its young in
the State of Maine.</p>
<p>These birds are great favorites with collectors. Coming northward, as
many species do in the months of April and May, when excursions to the
woods are attended with such agreeable accompaniments, the short period of
their stay is the most deeply interesting of the ornithological season, whether
the object be to study birds in the fields and woods, or only to procure choice
specimens for the cabinet. In either case, the observer or collector will find
himself greatly tempted by these attractive little birds, to the exclusion, probably,
of others, not so gay, perhaps, in plumage, but equally interesting in
other respects.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">279</div>
<p>Bird-collecting is the ultimate refinement,&mdash;the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of all the
sports of the field. It is attended with all the excitement, and requires all
the skill, of other shooting, with a much higher degree of theoretical information
and consequent gratification in its exercise. Personal activity, not
necessarily to be exerted over so great a space as in game-bird shooting,
but in a much greater diversity of locality, coolness, steadiness of hand,
quickness of eye and of ear, especially the latter;&mdash;in fact, all the accomplishments
of a first-rate shot, will be of service; and some of them are indispensable
to successful collecting. The main reliance is, however, on the
ear, for the detection of birds by their notes, and involves a knowledge, the
more accurate and discriminating the better, which can only be acquired by
experience, and always characterizes the true woodsman, whether naturalist
or hunter.</p>
<p>This ability is of incomparable value to the collector. Whether in the
tangled forest, the deep recesses of the swamp, on the sea-coast or in the
clear woodlands, on the mountain or in the prairie, it advises him of whatever
birds may be there, or affords him a higher gratification, announcing the presence
of a bird that he does not know. We recognise no more exquisite
pleasure than to hear a note that we are not acquainted with in the woods.
It is in the latter case, too, that the cultivated quickness of eye of the experienced
collector is especially important, and his coolness and steadiness of
nerve is fully tested. It will not do to be flustered. But in fact all these
qualities must be possessed for the acquirement of the smaller species of birds
found in the woodlands. Some species of Warblers, for instance, are constantly
in motion in the pursuit of insects, and are most frequently met with
in the tops of trees, and are, moreover, only to be killed with the finest shot,
or they are spoiled for specimens. The obtaining of these little birds often
requires the most accurate and skilful shooting.</p>
<p>There are comparatively few superior ornithological woodsmen, though we
are inclined to believe more amongst the naturalists of this country, than of
any other. There are some who never learn, though shooting for years; and
passages constantly occur in the works of authors, notwithstanding their professions,
and however honestly such may have been made, exciting immediate
suspicion that they were really little skilled in woodcraft. We know men who
have long been bird-collectors, but who have never acquired the ability to distinguish
species by their notes, nor in fact otherwise to any considerable extent.
On the other hand, we have gone repeatedly on excursions of several miles, in
company with naturalists and accomplished woodsmen, for the sole purpose
of hearing the note of a single species with which they had not before had
an opportunity of becoming acquainted. This has been especially the case
with reference to the Prairie Warbler (<i>Sylvicola discolor</i>), which is always to
be met with in the summer, in the sandy thickets and in neglected fields in
New Jersey, and has several notes very peculiar and characteristic.</p>
<p>It is by no means desirable, however, to be exclusively a naturalist of the
woods, and in fact the greatest degree of accomplishment that can be acquired
in this line, entitles one to but a very humble rank as a cultivator of Zoology.
There must be a combination of theoretical and practical acquirements, and
the gratification of the practical naturalist or the collector will be exactly in
<span class="pb" id="Page_280">280</span>
proportion to his scientific or systematic information, to be obtained only in
the museum and the library. There is an indescribably pitiful display of
ignorance and meanness of idea in arrogating, as some writers have done, a
superior position for the &ldquo;field-naturalist&rdquo; over the &ldquo;closet-naturalist.&rdquo; As
well might he who navigates a ship presume on being the greatest of astronomers,
or the practical gauger pretend to be the only mathematician. Great
is life in the woods, say we, and the greatest of all sports is bird-collecting;
but, to become a scientific ornithologist, is quite another business, and a very
much more considerable consummation. But we have digressed from the
Warblers.</p>
<p>In the neighborhood of the cities, and in fact throughout the Middle and
Northern States, during the last of April and the whole of May of every
year, numerous species of Warblers are to be found in abundance. It happens
occasionally though, that a species, usually common, is scarcely to be seen in
the whole season, and sometimes is rare for several seasons in succession.
The Black-throated blue Warbler (<i>Sylvicola canadensis</i>), for instance, is
generally very abundant in Pennsylvania in May, and so is the Chestnut-sided
(<i>S. icterocephala</i>); but we have noticed seasons in which all the collectors
of Philadelphia would scarcely obtain a specimen of either. It sometimes
happens, too, that a species makes its appearance in considerable numbers,
and then is of much less common occurrence for years. This was the case
with the Blackburnian Warbler in May, 1840. That beautiful little bird was
so abundant, that our early and intimate friend, the late Mr. William R.
Spackman, then anxious to collect for the purposes of general study and for
exchanges, shot upwards of twenty specimens during a morning&rsquo;s excursion
in company with us near Kaighn&rsquo;s Point, New Jersey; and had they been
wanted, could readily have obtained a much larger number in the afternoon,
or, as termed by bird-collectors in common with sportsmen, during &ldquo;the
evening fly.&rdquo; It continued very plentiful through the entire spring migration,
but we have not seen it so abundant more than once since, though fifteen
years have elapsed.</p>
<p>Very erroneous impressions relative to the rarity of several species of
Warblers, have been created by statements which have found their way into
the works of both Wilson and Audubon. For instance, the former of these
celebrated authors says of the Chestnut-sided Warbler:&mdash;&ldquo;In a whole day&rsquo;s
excursion it is rare to meet with more than one or two of these birds;&rdquo;&mdash;the
latter, at the time of the publication of the first volume of his Ornithological
Biography (1831), had met with this bird once only (Orn. Biog. I., p.
306), and so it stands printed in his octavo edition of &ldquo;The Birds of America,&rdquo;
(II., p. 35, 1840.) These rather extraordinary statements have caused
the useless destruction of very many specimens of this little bird, particularly
by young collectors, under a false estimate of its scarcity in collections, or
value for the purposes of science. There have been few months of May in
<span class="pb" id="Page_281">281</span>
the last twenty years, in which any person of moderate skill as a collector of
birds, could not have obtained, in the vicinity of Philadelphia, as many specimens
of the Chestnut-sided Warbler as would have supplied all the Museums
in the world.</p>
<p>Again, in the months of September and October, Warblers are abundant
in our woods, but the plumage of many species is materially altered from that
of Spring. The student of ornithology must by no means, however, neglect
to become acquainted with it, and will find this knowledge exceedingly valuable
and interesting, as he advances in this branch of science.</p>
<p>The bird represented in the plate now before the reader, is one of the
rarest as yet of the North American species of Warblers. Like several others
that are well established as species, it has been obtained once only, which was
in the vicinity of Cleveland, Ohio, by Professor J. P. Kirtland, of that city,
who presented it to Professor Baird, by whom its discovery was first announced
in the Annals of the New York Lyceum, as cited below.</p>
<p>This species is related to the Yellow-crowned Warbler, or Myrtle Bird, as
it is sometimes called (<i>Sylvicola coronata</i>), a common species of the United
States, and to Audubon&rsquo;s Warbler (<i>S. Auduboni</i>), a Western species, but
differs from them in strong and unmistakable characters. It is probably
a species inhabiting the more Western regions of the continent of North
America.</p>
<p>We are informed by Prof. Kirtland, that the specimen alluded to was shot
in the woods near Cleveland, and, so far as observed, was not noticed to differ
in habits essentially from <i>S. coronata</i>, or other of our species of Warblers
usually found migrating in the Spring. Though it was captured in the Spring
of 1852, and the species has been carefully looked for ever since at the same
season, it has never again been observed.</p>
<p>The figure in our plate is about two-thirds the size of life.</p>
<p>The plant represented is a species of <i>Penstemon</i> from Texas, raised in the
Horticultural establishment of Mr. Robert Kilvington, of this city.</p>

Ohio; a gentleman who, to a reputation in private life most exemplary and
unexceptionable, adds high distinction as a naturalist and pioneer of the
Zoological Sciences in the Western United States.</p>
<p>To our friend, Thomas M. Brewer, M. D., of Boston, we are indebted for
much valuable information on the incubation and breeding places of many of
the Warblers of the United States. This interesting department of Ornithology
has been a special matter of research with Dr. Brewer for many
years; and we are happy to learn that his great work on the Oology of North
America is shortly to appear under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution.
We venture to say that no more valuable contribution to American
Zoology has ever appeared.</p>

<br />PLATE XLVIII. Adult.</h2>
<p>Of this handsome and peculiar-looking Warbler, unfortunately we can say
very little. It is known as a bird of Mexico, but has been noticed within the
limits of the United States, as yet, in one instance only, having been received
from Texas by our friend, Mr. Jacob P. Giraud, Jun., of New York. At the
period of its receipt it was unknown to ornithologists, and it was accordingly
described by Mr. Giraud, with other new and interesting species, in his &ldquo;New
Species of Birds of North America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the time of the discovery of this bird, we have looked for it, with
constant interest, amongst the many new and little-known birds collected by
American naturalists in Texas, but in vain. It has not yet appeared again,
and is to be regarded as one of the now numerous birds of our country, of
which the history remains to be written by the future naturalist.</p>
<p>The Baron Du Bus, an ornithologist of Belgium, has received this bird from
Mexico; and specimens, also from that country, are in the collection of the
Philadelphia Academy. The short notice of it by the author just mentioned
in the Bulletin of the Royal Academy of Brussels, contains no account of its
history or of its habits; nor have we any information from other sources.
From the fact of its visiting Texas in the summer, however, we infer that it is
a species of which the Southern range probably extends into Central or perhaps
South America.</p>
<p>In general appearance, this bird somewhat resembles the Prothonotary
Warbler (<i>Helinaia protonotaria</i>), of the United States, but is much darker
colored, and it does not belong to the same group or sub-genus.</p>
<p>The figure in our plate is about two-thirds the natural size.</p>

<br />PLATE XLIX. Adult Male.</h2>
<p>Though not clearly made out as a bird entitled to a place in the ornithological
fauna of the United States, we have given the plate now before the
reader on grounds regarded as sufficient for the introduction of descriptions
of this magnificent species into the works of other American authors, though
it has never before been figured.</p>
<p>This is the largest of all known Woodpeckers, and is one of the most beautiful
in plumage. It belongs strictly to the same group or genus as other
large American species.</p>
<p>Though originally described by Mr. Gould as from California, and subsequently
supposed by Dr. Townsend and Mr. Audubon to have been seen by
the former in the Rocky Mountains, it has escaped the attention of all recent
American travellers and naturalists. The specimens in the collection of the
Philadelphia Academy are labelled as having been collected in Mexico. It
is probable that this fine bird is an inhabitant of the dense forests, the trees
of which attain such enormous dimensions in the western regions of North
America, a supposition coinciding with Dr. Townsend&rsquo;s observations on the
species seen by him, from which we shall present an extract in the course of
the present article.</p>
<p>In the immense forests which skirt the slopes of the Rocky Mountains in
the possessions of the United States, and of the Sierra Madre in Mexico, we
find a congenial locality for this giant of his tribe. In those regions the trees
are not less gigantic, travellers of unquestioned veracity having given two
hundred and fifty to three hundred and fifty feet as a heighth frequently to
be observed.</p>
<p>The first notice of this bird by an American naturalist is in Mr. Audubon&rsquo;s
Ornithological Biography, V., p. 313, who merely publishes a note from Dr.
Townsend, which was his only information respecting it, except Mr. Gould&rsquo;s
description. It will be seen that Dr. Townsend did not succeed in obtaining
specimens, though it is in all respects probable that the species now before us
is alluded to by him in the following, which we take the liberty of copying
from Mr. Audubon, as above:</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the 14th of August, 1834, I saw several specimens of a large black
Woodpecker, about the size of <i>Picus principalis</i>. A broad band of white
<span class="pb" id="Page_286">286</span>
appeared to extend transversely across the wings and back. It inhabited the
tall pine trees, and was very shy. The note was almost exactly that of the
Red-headed Woodpecker; so nearly, that at first Mr. Nuttall and myself
were both deceived by it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lingered behind the party, which at that time was travelling rapidly,
and at last got a shot at one of them with slugs, my large shot having been
entirely expended. The bird fell wounded in a thicket at a considerable distance.
I searched for an hour without finding it, and was at last compelled
to relinquish it and follow the party, which had been leaving me at a rapid
trot, to find my way as I best could, and keep out of the reach of Indians,
who were dogging us continually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On reference to Dr. Townsend&rsquo;s Narrative, (p. 123,) it will be seen that
this incident occurred on the Mallade River, in the Rocky Mountains. Though
he states that the bird mentioned by him was &ldquo;about the size of <i>Picus principalis</i>,&rdquo;
which is the Ivory-billed Woodpecker of the Southern States, it
must be borne in mind that he saw it at a distance only, and was therefore
readily mistaken. The present bird is very considerably larger than that
species.</p>
<p>In Dr. Pickering&rsquo;s notes we find one allusion which is very probably to this
bird:&mdash;&ldquo;A very large Ivory-billed species of <i>Picus</i> was spoken of by Dr.
Marsh as having been occasionally seen by him. It is larger, he says, than
any other Woodpecker of the United States, and is very difficult to approach.
It is probably the new California species described by Mr. Gould a few years
since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This memorandum occurs in that portion of Dr. Pickering&rsquo;s journal kept
in California, and we have no doubt relates to the bird now before us. To the
gentleman mentioned, Dr. Marsh of San Joaquim, California, Dr. Pickering
frequently acknowledges his obligations for information, which is often of
high value, and is of evident reliability.</p>
<p>We have now given the only two instances, mere glimpses as it were, in
which this large Woodpecker has come under the notice of American travellers
or naturalists in its native localities. It is to be regretted that such is the
case, and perhaps somewhat extraordinary, on account of its conspicuous size
and colors; but it is expressly stated to be of a shy disposition, and difficult
to obtain. Its well known existence in California, and the fact that so few
of our naturalists have observed or heard of it, is additional evidence of the
yet partial character of our knowledge of the ornithology of that country.</p>
<p>Mr. Gould&rsquo;s description of this bird is in the Proceedings of the Zoological
Society of London for 1832, p. 140; and, with the statement accompanying
it, is the only notice of this species that has yet appeared in Europe. The
latter is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Specimens were exhibited of a species of Woodpecker hitherto undescribed,
which has recently been obtained by Mr. Gould, from that little explored district
<span class="pb" id="Page_287">287</span>
of California which borders the territory of Mexico. The exhibition
was accompanied by a communication from Mr. Gould, in which, after some
general remarks on the <i>Picid&aelig;</i> and their geographical distribution, he referred
to the species before the Committee as possessing the characters of the
genus <i>Picus</i> in their most marked development, together with the greatest
size hitherto observed in that group. In this respect it as far exceeds the
<i>Ivory-billed Woodpecker</i> of the United States <i>Picus principalis</i>, as the latter
does the <i>Picus martius</i> of Europe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This species is readily distinguishable from the <i>P. principalis</i>, by its
much larger size, by the length of its occipital crest, the pendent silky feathers
of which measure nearly four inches, by the absence of the white stripe
which ornaments the neck of that bird, and by the bristles which cover its
nostrils being black, whereas those of the <i>Picus principalis</i> are white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These notices comprise, at present, all that is known of the largest and one
of the handsomest of Woodpeckers. Its history, yet to be written, will be a
highly interesting contribution to the ornithology of the United States.</p>
<p>Several specimens of this bird, in the collection of the Philadelphia Academy,
are stated on their labels to be from Mexico, without other note or
indication. All of them were obtained in Europe by our distinguished patrons,
Messrs. Thomas B. and Edward Wilson.</p>
<p>The adult male is represented in the present plate. The female differs
essentially only in having the crest black instead of scarlet.</p>

<p>This gigantic Woodpecker is strictly of the same generic group as the well
known Ivory-billed Woodpecker of the forests of the Southern States of this
Union, and in some measure resembles it, but not in such degree as to be
readily confounded. The present bird is considerably the larger, and is without
the white stripes on the neck which are to be found in the Ivory-billed.
In both species, the females have the elongated or crest-like feathers black.</p>
<p>It is quite remarkable that this fine species has not been brought by any
of the naturalists or travellers who have visited, or at least passed through
its native forests. This fact tends to demonstrate the truth of our views,
occasionally expressed in the present volume, that we have much yet to learn
of the Ornithology of Western America.</p>

<br />The Short-tailed Albatross.
<br />PLATE L. Adult Male.</h2>
<p>This Albatross is the adult of the bird represented in <a href="#fig35">plate 35</a>, (the
Black-footed Albatross, <i>Diomedea nigripes</i>, Aud.) of the present volume.
At the time of the publication of the plate alluded to, and our article accompanying
it, we were not aware of this identity; but having had our attention
called to it by a distinguished European ornithologist, we have, on careful
re-examination and comparison, fully confirmed its truth. So great a change
taking place, however, in this bird, from early age to maturity, the two figures
only fairly represent the species, of which that formerly given, as above, is
the young bird.</p>
<p>The common occurrence of this species on the coasts of California and
Oregon, was ascertained by the naturalists of the Exploring Expedition in
the Vincennes and Peacock, under command of Captain Charles Wilkes, of
the United States&rsquo; Navy; and its addition to the ornithology of North America
is one of many services to Zoology performed by that celebrated and
most important Expedition. In fact, of the many similar undertakings of
governments for the purposes of exploration and scientific research within
the present century, the expedition alluded to stands pre-eminent in its contributions
to Geographical and Zoological Science, a result to be attributed
to the enlightened and judicious exertions of its distinguished Commander,
and to the fact that it numbered amongst its naturalists several of the most
accomplished Zoologists of America.</p>
<p>This Albatross probably inhabits the entire extent of the Pacific Ocean,
from the northern coasts of America and Asia to Australia. It is given by
Mr. Gould as a bird of the coast of Australia, though somewhat doubtfully,
and is very probably the species sometimes mistaken for the Great Wandering
Albatross (<i>D. exulans</i>), and found abundantly in the vicinity of the Kurile
Islands and the coast of Kamtschatka, and other more southern coasts of
Asia. It is smaller than the species just mentioned, but otherwise much resembles
it. That species, though abundant in the southern hemisphere, does
not apparently venture so far north as the present bird.</p>
<p>In a volume on Quadrupeds and Birds, by Mr. Titian R. Peale, which was
printed and partially distributed as one of the valuable series of works on
<span class="pb" id="Page_290">290</span>
the scientific results of the Exploring Expedition of the Vincennes and Peacock,
we find the following in relation to the bird now before us:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Numbers of the Short-tailed Albatross were observed by the Expedition
on the Northwest coast of America, and this species is believed to be a common
inhabitant of all the Pacific Ocean, north of the Tropic of Cancer.
Specimens vary as much, or perhaps more, from each other, than in the
Wandering Albatross (<i>Diomedea exulans</i>), of the Southern Ocean, and require
several years to attain to their perfect dress. The changes are regularly
progressive. Until the second year the plumage remains of a dark
sooty-brown color, with black feet, and dirty flesh-colored bills (which become
black when the skins are dried), and in this state this bird pairs and raises its
first young; after this, cloudy-white spots appear about the base of the bill,
and white spots over and under the eyes; the rump begins to show a conspicuous
spot of the same; and the bill turns yellow, with a tinge of carmine;
the tip bluish; the legs are then flesh-colored; and, finally, the back, wings,
and tail, become cinereous-brown; rump, head, and all the under parts pure
white; a white margin shows along the back-edge of the wing in flight; and
a cloudy-black spot generally remains in front of the eye. Thus, in some
years, the plumage of the body is changed from nearly black to a pure snow-like
white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the 20th of December we found this species breeding on Wake&rsquo;s Island.
The single egg of each pair was laid on the ground, in a slight concavity,
without any lining material; both sexes take turns in the duties of incubation,
and neither the male nor the female abandoned the nest on our approach, but
walked around us in a very dignified manner, and made but a few demonstrations
of defence with their beaks, when taken up in our arms. The eggs are
white, of an oblong figure, nearly alike at both ends, and measure four and
two-tenths inches long, and two and six-tenths inches in diameter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The two sexes are alike in plumage, and do not vary much in size, though
the male is rather the larger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bird is usually silent, but sometimes quarrels with its fellows over the
offal thrown from ships, when it &ldquo;brays&rdquo; in much the same tone as a jackass.
It is easily caught with a hook and line, but owing to its thick plumage and
tenacity of life, it is difficult to kill it with shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not our fortune to observe more than this one species of Albatross
in the North Pacific. It is subject to great variations of plumage, as stated
above, but is very distinct from the species of the Southern Hemisphere.
The Wandering Albatross (<i>D. exulans</i>), and the Yellow-nosed (<i>D. chlororhynchus</i>),
both of which, it has been asserted, have been sometimes found in the
Northern Oceans, we believe, on the contrary, to be entirely restricted to the
Southern hemisphere, or else they would sometimes be seen in crossing the
intermediate tropical region. We saw both of those species, and also the
Sooty Albatross (<i>D. fusca</i>), as far south as latitude 57&deg; 41&prime;, which appeared
<span class="pb" id="Page_291">291</span>
to be nearly their southern limit. Their northern limit of migration on the
Atlantic shores of South America is somewhere about the River La Plata,
and on the Pacific coasts about the southern parts of Peru.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Dr. Pickering&rsquo;s Journal this bird is alluded to frequently, and especially
as occurring at sea north of the Hawaiian Islands, and on the coast of
Oregon. His observations agree with those by Mr. Peale, above quoted.</p>
<p>This species is given by Messrs. Temminck and Schlegel, as a bird of Japan,
in their Fauna Japonica, and is well figured in its young plumage, but they
give no account of its manners or history.</p>
<p>The figure in our plate represents the adult male, and was made from a
specimen obtained on the coast of Kamtschatka, now in the Museum of the
Philadelphia Academy, but precisely similar to others in the collection of the
Exploring Expedition in the National Museum, Washington city.</p>

<p>Of the smaller species of the Albatrosses, this is the largest and next in
size to the large <i>D. exulans</i>, which it much resembles in general appearance.
It may always, however, be readily distinguished from any other species by
the characters given above. Specimens occur in which the pale yellow tinge
of the head and neck is not distinguishable, but usually it is a strongly marked
character.</p>
<p>It was by our friend, that distinguished ornithologist, Gustav Hartlaub,
M. D., Director of the Museum of the city of Bremen, that our attention
<span class="pb" id="Page_292">292</span>
was first called to the fact of this bird and the Black-footed Albatross being
identical, and a re-examination suggested. Not for this only are we indebted
to the same gentleman, but for much advice and instruction most encouraging
and valuable, and a constant assurance of good feeling, uninterrupted for
years. Naturalists of all climes should work out their mission in harmony
and fellowship. It is often not so,&mdash;would that all like Hartlaub cultivated
and understood, as well as Science, kindness, friendship, justice.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>But we are at the close of our volume. Like the traveller at the end of
his day&rsquo;s journey, or the husbandman when the sun has sunk behind the hills,
we willingly stop for repose, not without thoughts mainly, and perhaps necessarily,
retrospective, but agreeable.</p>
<p>Reader! our barks have glided together for a period on the great stream
which carries us alike to our future destiny. Thou hast been to me as a
companion most pleasant, and an encourager. We have chatted, not always,
perhaps, with sufficient reverence, or possibly sometimes frivolously, of the
magnificence of our pathway,&mdash;of the mountain and the forest,&mdash;even of the
birds that sing in the branches. By no means without dignity of subject,&mdash;the
highest dignity attaches to all created things as the realized ideas of
Omnipotence.</p>
<p>We could wish that some passages in our book were more clearly stated;
but there is little that we would erase. We aspire to no perfection, much less
have we accomplished any. Imperfection is a characteristic of mankind.
Man exists in this world as an intellectual being, in a rudimental condition
only.</p>
<p>Trust not too implicitly in the delights of the wilds, nor of solitude. They
are temporary, and only to be as a teacher,&mdash;we must return ever to social life
as the ark of safety, bringing, we may hope, the olive-branch of peace with
knowledge. For all that I have said, or that any one else has said, our
greatest and truest interests are in society. There only we acquire true
cultivation and elevation. Science, Literature, Art, the great civilizers,
there only flourish. Betake thyself not to the wilderness, or for a period
only, and never longer than forty days,&mdash;never!&mdash;if there is any help
for it.</p>
<p>We part now,&mdash;I would that it may be lover-like, oft promising to meet
again, and hoping ever,&mdash;parted already, as it were, and distant, perhaps,
by the length and breadth of our native land, or by the wide waters of the
Atlantic,&mdash;from my heart I waft to thee a blessing and a farewell.</p>

to species of marine plants of the genus <i>Macrocystis</i> which
grow profusely in the sea on the Pacific coast of the American continent. The species
particularly alluded to as abounding on the coast of California is one of the most gigantic of
plants, having been observed upwards of three hundred feet in length, and occurs in such
immense and dense masses as to present formidable difficulties to the navigator. For
this reason many localities of this extraordinary plant have been carefully marked in the
charts containing the results of the Coast Survey now being made by order of the Government
of the United States. All the recent travellers in California represent it as being cast on the
shore in large quantities by the action of the sea, and it could probably be as readily applied
to the production of Barilla (carbonate of soda) as any other marine species of the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
